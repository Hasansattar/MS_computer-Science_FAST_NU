abstract={Current global snow retrieval algorithms based on spaceborne microwave measurements inherit noticeable biases and uncertainties regarding spatial distribution and temporal variations. In this article, we present an improved spatiotemporally dynamic global snow depth retrieval algorithm to account for the heterogeneity of snowpacks in different seasons worldwide. The proposed model adopts nonlinear machine learning to retrieve snow depths from passive microwave measurements and other auxiliary information. We indirectly characterized the variation in snow grain size using the daily profiles of the temperature gradient within the snowpack. In addition, a zoning and multitemporal modeling strategy was employed to reduce the bias and uncertainty caused by snow heterogeneity across different ecoregions and seasons. The proposed model was implemented to retrieve the global daily snow depth from 2001 to 2010. The results were validated by in situ observations and compared with the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) snow water equivalent product (AE_DySno). Satisfactory accuracy was achieved for different ecoregions with regard to daily, monthly, and yearly validations (the root-mean-square error (RMSE) varied from ~7.5 to ~12 cm; the Pearson correlation coefficient $R$ ranged from 0.75 to 0.85). The results of ten trials indicated the promising stability of the proposed model in different ecoregions with small variations in RMSE and $R$ values. Compared with the AE_DySno products, the estimation results did not exhibit the overestimation problem and provided snow depth patterns with greater spatial heterogeneity, showing RMSEs ~5 cm lower and $R$ values ~0.3 higher than those of the AE_DySno products.},

abstract={The Global Land Surface Temperature is the radiative skin temperature of ground, depending on factors, which includes the albedo, the vegetation covers and the soil moisture. To predict the changes in temperature in a particular region is becoming increasingly important to capture the future trends in that region. Machine Learning is a specialized branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which gives computers the power to learn and make predictions from the data, without being explicitly programmed. In this work, Ensemble Approach for Global Land Temperatures (EAGLT) is proposed. This approach will help to predict the temperature, which is of great requirement as the problem of global warming is increasing day by day. Temperatures are collected from different cities and prediction is done using this approach. The proposed ensemble approach is based on three models which provide good performance in terms of model evaluation parameters like Correlation, Accuracy, R-Squared (R2), Root mean square (RMSE) and Total Time to detect the predicted temperatures. Cross Validation is performed on the best performing models to check the robustness of these selected models.},

abstract={Based on NASA's 40 years of satellite data, earth has experienced drastic climatic changes in the form of sea-level rise, an increase in oceanic and atmospheric temperatures, depletion of the Ozone layer, and decrease in sea ice and snow cover. These observations point to the fact that the world is getting warmer, which significantly impacts humans and ecological systems. Forecasting global land temperature could help to identify the extent of devasting consequences on the natural habitat and shed light on the impact of policies, designed to mitigate them. Previous studies have attempted to forecast regional temperatures using traditional machine learning models. This paper uses a standard multi-layer perceptron, a simple Recurrent Neural Network, and a Long Short-Term Memory network to forecast next month's global land temperature. Our results show that deep learning outperforms traditional machine learning models, including decision tree, random forest, and ridge regression.},

abstract={Uncertainty in weather dynamics makes it important to build accurate weather prediction systems because it can save lives by better preparing people for an upcoming incidence. The aim of present research study is to present a comprehensive review of recent scientific works for short term temperature and rainfall prediction on both local and global spatial scale. The literature shows that some meteorological factors like Atmospheric pressure, precipitation, dew point temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure, cloud cover, snowfall, humidity, wind velocity and wind direction are potential measures to predict future temperature and rainfall. We focused on recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models like Deep Echo State Network, recurrent neural network, convolutional recurrent neural network, and graph convolutional network, Autoencoders, Multi layer Perceptron and Long short-term memory. Applications of multimodal learning, reservoir computing and multitask learning have shown noticeable enhancement in the prediction accuracy of other state of art the models. Fine capability of CNN to extract suitable patterns from numeric weather data is also reported. The time interval of data recording also affects the prediction accuracy greatly. More frequently recorded input data worked better than less frequently recorded data. The use of electromagnetic sensors instead of satellite and radar setups is reliable as well as cost effective for collecting data for prediction. Evaluation indices related to hit rate of rainfall and no rainfall, caching rate, overlooking rate and Swing-and-miss rate can be considered as statistical measures along with other statistical metrics in case of rainfall prediction.},
