abstract={Surface longwave downward radiation (LWDR) plays an important role in modulating greenhouse effect and climate change. Constructing a global longtime series LWDR dataset is greatly necessary to systematically and in-depth study the LWDR effect on the climate. However, the current multisource LWDR products (satellite and reanalysis) show large differences in terms of both spatiotemporal resolutions and accuracy in various regions. Therefore, it is necessary to fuse multisource datasets to generate more accurate LWDR with high spatiotemporal resolution on a global scale. To this end, a downscaling strategy is first proposed to generate LWDR dataset with 0.25° resolution from CERES-SYN data with 1° scale, by incorporating the land surface temperature (LST), total column water vapor (TCWV), and elevation. Then, a machine learning-based fusion method is provided to generate a global hourly LWDR dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.25° by combining three products (CERES-SYN, ERA5, and GLDAS). Compared with ground measurements, the performance of generated LWDR product reveals that the correlation coefficient ( $R$ ), mean bias error (BIAS), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.97, −0.95 W/m2, and 22.38 W/m2 over the land and 0.99, −0.88 W/m2, and 10.96 W/m2 over the ocean, respectively. In particular, it shows improved accuracy in the low and middle latitude regions compared with other LWDR products. Considering its better accuracy and higher spatiotemporal resolution, the new LWDR product can provide essential data for deeply understanding the global energy balance and even the global warming. Moreover, the proposed fusion strategy can be enlightening for readers in the fields of multisource data combination and big data analysis.},

abstract={The Precipitable Water Vapor is an important quantity for both meteorological and GNSS satellite-based positioning applications. Its quantification is closely related to the mean temperature of the tropospheric vertical column along the height, which is often obtained by using radiosonde database-based models. However, radiosonde profiles are generally not available when acquiring satellite-based positioning data. Usually, the mean temperature model is adopted to overcome this problem. The mean temperature models have been developed on the basis of the application of the classical linear regression. In that case, radiosonde profiles-based mean temperatures are linearly related to pressure and temperature surface measurements. Here, on the other hand, we purpose to use machine learning algorithms to model the mean temperature, namely Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM) and Random Forest Regressor (RF). For this study, we use a dataset with 30 years of radiosonde observations over the Brazilian region. In general, the results are consistent with those provided in the literature [1].},

abstract={The Global Land Surface Temperature is the radiative skin temperature of ground, depending on factors, which includes the albedo, the vegetation covers and the soil moisture. To predict the changes in temperature in a particular region is becoming increasingly important to capture the future trends in that region. Machine Learning is a specialized branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which gives computers the power to learn and make predictions from the data, without being explicitly programmed. In this work, Ensemble Approach for Global Land Temperatures (EAGLT) is proposed. This approach will help to predict the temperature, which is of great requirement as the problem of global warming is increasing day by day. Temperatures are collected from different cities and prediction is done using this approach. The proposed ensemble approach is based on three models which provide good performance in terms of model evaluation parameters like Correlation, Accuracy, R-Squared (R2), Root mean square (RMSE) and Total Time to detect the predicted temperatures. Cross Validation is performed on the best performing models to check the robustness of these selected models.},

abstract={Money laundering has been a global issue for decades, which is one of the major threat for economy and society. Government, regulatory and financial institutions are combating it together in their respective capacity, however still billions of dollars in fines by authorities make the headlines in the news. High-speed internet services have enabled financial institutions to deliver better customer experience through multi-channel engagements, which has led to exponential growth in transactions and new avenues for laundering the money for fraudsters. Literature shows the usage of statistical methods, data mining and Machine Learning (ML) techniques for money laundering detection, but limited research on Deep Learning (DL) techniques, primarily due to lack of model interpretability and explainability of the decisions made. Several studies are conducted on application of ML for Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques in general, but lacks the study on usage of DL techniques together with XAI. This paper aims to review the current state-of-the-art literature on DL together with XAI for identifying suspicious money laundering transactions and identify future research areas. Key findings of the review are, researchers have preferred variants of Convolutional Neural Networks, and AutoEncoder; graph deep learning together with natural language processing is emerging as an important technology for AML; XAI use is not seen in AML domain; 51% ML methods used in AML are non-interpretable, 58% studies used sample of old real data; key challenges for researchers are access to recent real transaction data and scarcity of labelled training data; and data being highly imbalanced. Future research directions are, application of XAI techniques to bring-out explainability, graph deep learning using natural language processing (NLP), unsupervised and reinforcement learning to handle lack of labelled data; and joint research programs between research community and industry to benefit from domain knowledge and controlled access to data.},

pages={1-5},
abstract={The frequency of heatwave events has increased in recent decades because of global warming. Satellite observed land surface temperature (LST) is a widely used parameter for assessing heatwaves. It provides a wide spatial coverage compared to surface air temperature measured at weather stations. However, LST quality is limited by cloud contamination. Because heatwaves have a limited temporal frame, having a full and cloud-free complement of LST for that period is necessary. In this letter, we explore gap filling of LST using spatial features such as land cover, elevation, and vegetation indices in a machine learning approach. We use a seamless open and free daily vegetation index product that is paramount to the success of our study. We create a random forest model that provides a ranking of features relevant for predicting LST. We compare the output of our model to an established spatiotemporal gap-filling algorithm to validate the predictive capability of our model. This study validates machine learning as a suitable tool for filling gaps in satellite LST. In addition, we acknowledge that while time is an important factor in predicting LST, additional information on vegetation can improve the predictions of a model.},

year={2022},

pages={13-20},
abstract={Additive manufacturing (AM) is the computer-aided design for the successive addition of layers by layer material. It is widely used because of the fast prototyping using laser metal deposition, which is difficult to implement using conventional techniques. Understanding the temperature profile prediction is necessary in AM processes, such as Bed Fusion process (PBF) technology to produce the right quality parts. Thus, the temperature profile prediction using Artificial intelligence techniques, like data-driven models and real-time iterative models using complex geometries, require real time control systems by considering the in-situ data. Besides, enhancing the accuracy of prediction is the hectic challenge faced by the existing systems. Hence, the proposed temperature profile prediction is developed hised on an Artificial intelligence method named Global herding algorithm based neural network (global herding-based NN) to overcome the challenges associated with the existing methods. The proposed global herding optimization is developed by hybridizing the herding characteristics associated with the standard Elephant herding optimization (EHO) and Rhino Herd (RH) optimization to boost the solution’s global optimal convergence. Moreover, the integration of the proposed glohil herding optimization with the NN model ensures the optimal selection of the hyper-parameters of the NN classifier, which renders effective performance of the temperature profile prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed model is revealed hised on the performance metrics, such as MAE of 11.778, MAPE of 3.432, and MSE of 11.778.},

pages={1-17},
abstract={Current global snow retrieval algorithms based on spaceborne microwave measurements inherit noticeable biases and uncertainties regarding spatial distribution and temporal variations. In this article, we present an improved spatiotemporally dynamic global snow depth retrieval algorithm to account for the heterogeneity of snowpacks in different seasons worldwide. The proposed model adopts nonlinear machine learning to retrieve snow depths from passive microwave measurements and other auxiliary information. We indirectly characterized the variation in snow grain size using the daily profiles of the temperature gradient within the snowpack. In addition, a zoning and multitemporal modeling strategy was employed to reduce the bias and uncertainty caused by snow heterogeneity across different ecoregions and seasons. The proposed model was implemented to retrieve the global daily snow depth from 2001 to 2010. The results were validated by in situ observations and compared with the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) snow water equivalent product (AE_DySno). Satisfactory accuracy was achieved for different ecoregions with regard to daily, monthly, and yearly validations (the root-mean-square error (RMSE) varied from ~7.5 to ~12 cm; the Pearson correlation coefficient $R$ ranged from 0.75 to 0.85). The results of ten trials indicated the promising stability of the proposed model in different ecoregions with small variations in RMSE and $R$ values. Compared with the AE_DySno products, the estimation results did not exhibit the overestimation problem and provided snow depth patterns with greater spatial heterogeneity, showing RMSEs ~5 cm lower and $R$ values ~0.3 higher than those of the AE_DySno products.},

abstract={Due to climate changes, global warming, and the recent drought, forecasting, checking, and analyzing maximum temperatures as one of the foremost imperative climatic parameters allows planners to plan and provide the necessary arrangements. The main reasons for checking the temperature as a parameter influencing nature are agriculture, pests, diseases, melting ice and flooding, evaporation and transpiration, and drought. Today, artificial neural networks are used to predict time series like temperature because of their feature for understanding the random mechanism of fully nonlinear and complex series. This study used data from 1953 to 2005, two methods, and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural networks with the learning algorithm after the error propagation to analyze and check the monthly maximum temperature. This issue used an input layer, five hidden layers of TANSIG, and an output layer of the pure line for artificial neural networks. The mean squared error criterion was also used to assess the results. In the following study, 70% of the total data were used as training data (RMSE = 1.8622 and MSE = 3.4677); in order to avoid the phenomenon of the over-load network, 15% of the data were used for validation data (RMSE = 1.7667 and MSE = 3.1213). The remaining 15 percent has also been used to check and test data. (RMSE = 2.134 and MSE = 4.5538). A comparison of monthly maximum temperature forecast results for 1953 and 2005 with observed data shows good agreement of the model. The overall results indicate that approximately every 64 years will add a degree to the temperature.},

abstract={River eelgrass has a vital role in the coastal ecosystem, which can be threatened by human activities and climate change. Accurate mapping of eelgrass habitats is important for sustainable eelgrass conservation and management. A large portion of the Shediac river in the province of New Brunswick, Canada is covered by eelgrass, which can be threatened by different natural and anthropogenic activities, such as bridge construction. Thus, mapping and monitoring eelgrass in this river are of interest to the province. In this study, a very high-resolution Worldview-3 image along with an Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) unsupervised classification algorithm was applied to map eelgrass over a portion of Shediac river. The results indicated a reasonable classification accuracy, and it was observed that 90,416.43 m2 of the study area was covered by river eelgrass.},

abstract={The thermokarst lake is one of the most typical thermal and thawing disasters, and also an key sign of permafrost degradation. It has a strong impact on the study of global climate change. In this paper, the Beilu river basin in Qinghai Tibet Plateau was selected as an example. With the global availability Landsat data (TM, ETM+, OLI), we obtained the multi-spectral indices, which is closely related to the state of thermokarst lakes rich area. Then, the longterm change trend parameter sets of the multi-spectral indices from 2000 to 2020 are taken as the input data sets of machine learning method to accurately characterize the change state of the thermokarst lakes. Based on the proposed machine learning method, the dynamic change results of the thermokarst lake rich area were obtained pixel by pixel. The results show that it is an effective way for thermokarst lake dynamics analysis within the permafrost region. It is not only helpful to predict and control the change of thermokarst lakes, but also has important practical significance for the study of global climate change.},

title={Spatial Gap-Filling of SMAP Soil Moisture Pixels Over Tibetan Plateau via Machine Learning Versus Geostatistics},
year={2021},
volume={14},

pages={9899-9912},
abstract={Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in ecology, environment, agriculture, and hydrology. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite provides global SM products with reliable accuracy since 2015. However, significant gaps of SMAP SM appeared over Tibetan Plateau. Considering the important role of the Tibetan Plateau in global climate and environment, it is essential to develop methods to infill the gaps to generate seamless SMAP SM data. To address this issue, we proposed two methods, machine learning and geostatistics technique. For the machine learning technique, we train a Random Forest algorithm which aims to match the output of available SMAP L3 SM using a series of input variables such as SMAP brightness temperature (TBH and TBV) in ascending orbits (6:00 PM local time), surface temperature, MODIS NDVI, land cover, DEM, and other auxiliary data. Then, the established RF estimators were applied to the SMAP brightness temperature from descending orbits (6:00 AM local time) to reconstruct complete SM data over the Tibetan Plateau. For the geostatistics technique, the Ordinary kriging was applied to the available SMAP L3 SM pixels to interpolate complete SM data. To cross-validate the performances of the algorithms, we assume certain areas with available SMAP SM values as missing, and then compared the gap-filling results with the actual ones. The cross-validations show that the gap-filling results from two algorithms were highly correlated to the official SMAP SM products with high coefficients of determination (R2RF = 0.97 and R2OK = 0.85) and low RMSE (RMSERF = 0.015 cm3/cm3 and RMSEOK = 0.036 cm3/cm3). Furthermore, the gap-filling SM data present a better correlation with the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity SM data (R = 0.55–0.7) than the Global Land Data Assimilation System simulations (R = 0.18–0.62). The reconstructed SM from RF (R = 0.71) and OK (R = 0.55) algorithms are well related to the Maqu network measurements. Thus, the machine learning and geostatistics algorithms have the potential to reproduce the missing SMAP SM products over the Tibetan Plateau.},

abstract={Mapping lithological units of an area using remote sensing data can be broadly grouped into pixel-based (PBIA), sub-pixel based (SPBIA) and object-based (GEOBIA) image analysis approaches. Since it is not only the datasets adequacy but also the correct classification selection that influences the lithological mapping. This research is intended to analyze and evaluate the efficiency of these three approaches for lithological mapping in semi-arid areas, by using Sentinel-2A data and many algorithms for image enhancement and spectral analysis, in particular two specialized Band Ratio (BR) and the Independent component analysis (ICA), for that reason the Paleozoic Massif of Skhour Rehamna, situated in the western Moroccan Meseta was chosen. In this study, the support vector machine (SVM) that is theoretically more efficient machine learning algorithm (MLA) in geological mapping is used in PBIA and GEOBIA approaches. The evaluation and comparison of the performance of these different methods showed that SVM-GEOBIA approach gives the highest overall classification accuracy (OA $\approx ~93$ %) and kappa coefficient (K) of 0, 89, while SPBIA classification showed OA of approximately 89% and kappa coefficient of 0, 84, whereas the lithological maps resulted from SVM-PBIA method exhibit salt and pepper noise, with a lower OA of 87% and kappa coefficient of 0, 80 comparing them with the other classification approaches. From the results of this comparative study, we can conclude that the SVM-GEOBIA classification approach is the most suitable technique for lithological mapping in semi-arid regions, where outcrops are often inaccessible, which complicates classic cartographic work.},

abstract={The environmental health of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is crucial to the survival of the planet. LAC countries occupy 13% of the Earths landmass yet contain 60% of the terrestrial life. The region is particularly brittle as climate change looms on the horizon, and its economic reliance on exploiting natural resources is accelerating its biodiversity loss. Central to these problems is that LAC is the most economically unequal region globally. Thus, it faces unique challenges in promoting sustainable development. This paper explores whether and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) may provide methods to accelerate the changes needed to increase resilience and facilitate adaptation. Starting with a systematic mapping of the research on AI for sustainability in LAC, we present a diagnosis of the current situation structured along the proposed axes of climate change, human vulnerability, and biodiversity. Then, we give some illustrative examples of potential directions for further work with applicability to the region. Due to its often overlooked resources, capabilities, and particularly fragile geolocation, LAC is called to play an oversize role in the planets sustainability in the coming decades.},

Optimizing the hyperparameters for accurate temperature forecasting is challenging. This paper presents Cauchy Particle-swarm optimization (CPSO) technique for finding the hyperparameters of the LSTM. The proposed technique minimizes the validation mean square error rate (MSER) to improve accuracy. We test the proposed technique on 30-year Riyadh city temperature datasets.

Forecasting global land temperature could help to identify the extent of devasting consequences on the natural habitat and shed light on the impact of policies, designed to mitigate them.

This approach was implemented over the Mexico City as a case study, in order to forecast possible future traffic events in the city, in which the citizens share their particular situation to discover alternatives routes for avoiding the traffic congestion. Future works are oriented towards designing mobile applications in order to introduce the proposed approach and integrate information from multiple platforms and navigation systems.},

abstract={Landslides are among the deadliest natural disasters in the world. With the rising effects of climate change, extreme events responsible for triggering landslides are becoming more and more frequent. This paper uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to develop the first deep learning geospatial model for landslides in the Rif (North of Morocco), and compares its performance in landslide susceptibility mapping with logistic regression. The models input parameters can be derived from free geospatial data, which makes this approach efficient and applicable over large areas. The models were validated using landslide data derived from geological maps of the Rif area. We noted an accuracy of 0.85 for the ANN model and 0.69 for the logistic regression model respectively. A susceptibility index map was generated in the Aknoul region in the Rif to illustrate the ANN results. We found that areas with very high susceptibility index are affected the most by landslides.},

pages={5760-5763},
abstract={This research aimed at exploiting the joint use of machine learning and polarimetry for improving the retrieval of surface soil moisture (SMC) from SAR acquisitions at C- and X-band.The study was conducted on an alpine test area in Italy and two agricultural areas in Canada, for which series of Radarsat-2 (RS2) and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) images were available along with direct measurements of SMC from in-situ stations. The analysis confirmed the sensitivity of SAR backscattering (σ°) from both sensors to the SMC variations, with similar correlations (R ≃0.5). The comparison of SMC with the Compact Polarimetric (CP) parameters, computed from the RS2 acquisitions by Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) data simulator pointed out that the right and left polarized signals and the Shannon entropy intensity also have some sensitivity to SMC variations, with R ≃0.4 for all the three parameters.Based on these results, two different machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have been implemented and tested on the available data. On the South Tyrol test area, both SVR and ANN tested with different combinations of RS2 and CSK data were able to retrieve SMC with a RMSE between 4% and 6% of SMC and R between 0.78 and 0.88, depending on the combination of inputs. The ANN algorithm based on CP data was tested on the Canada areas, being able to estimate SMC with a RMSE between 2% and 5% of SMC and R between 0.85 and 0.96.},

pages={109544-109557},
abstract={Ocean heat content (OHC) is an essential parameter to assess Earth’s energy imbalance, global warming, and climate change over the historical record. An accurate estimate of the OHC in the Arctic sea ice regions is challenging due to the lack of in-situ data and satellite-based algorithms. In this study, an artificial neural network-based (ANN) novel approach is presented for estimating OHC changes at various standard depth extents (in line with the World Ocean Atlas-2018 depth levels) in the Arctic sea ice regions based on the relationships of the sea ice thermodynamic parameters from the satellite measurements and in-situ OHC estimates. Because of the potential uncertainty that arises from the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer in the in-situ OHC estimates, a preliminary ANN model was developed with a set of approximations to account for the in-situ OHC stored in the respective depths within the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer. The ANN model architecture was optimized for a depth extent of 700 m and adopted for the remaining depths of 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, 50 m, 100 m,150 m, 200 m, 250 m, 300 m, 350 m, 400 m, 450 m, 500 m, 550 m, 600 m, and 650 m. The new model was robust in capturing the spatial, temporal, and depth variabilities of OHC in the sea ice-covered Arctic regions with greater accuracy (mean bias error 0.022 GJ m−2, mean bias percentage error 0.015%, mean absolute error 0.182 GJ m−2, mean absolute percentage error 0.148%, root mean square error 0.24 GJ m−2, R−2 0.94, slope 0.93, and intercept 25.05 GJ m−2). This model is capable of estimating OHC and its temporal trends from satellite data which will have implications for understanding the global climate change and its impacts in the Polar Oceans.},

abstract={The rapid development of remote sensing technology has brought abundant data support for deep learning based temperature forecasting research. However, recently proposed methods usually focus on the temporal relationship among temperature observation information, whereas ignore the spatial positions of different regions. Motivated by the observation that adjacent regions usually present similar temperature trends, in this article, we consider the temperature forecasting as a spatiotemporal sequence prediction problem, and propose a new deep learning model for temperature forecasting, self-attention joint spatiotemporal network (SA-JSTN), which simultaneously captures the spatiotemporal interdependency information. The kernel component of the SA-JSTN is a newly developed spatiotemporal memory (STM) unit, which describes the temporal and spatial models via a unified memory cell. STM is constructed based on the units of the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). Instead of using simple convolutions for spatial information extraction, in STM, we improve ConvLSTM by a self-attention module, which has significantly enhanced the global spatial information representation ability of our proposed network. Compared with other deep learning based temperature forecasting methods, SA-JSTN is able to integrate the global spatial correlation into the temperature series prediction problem, and thus present better performance especially in short-term prediction. We have conducted comparison experiments on two typical temperature datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

year={2022},
volume={23},

pages={22737-22754},
abstract={Railway track geometry varies along routes depending on topographical, operational and safety constraints. Tracks are prone to degrade over time due to various factors, with deviations from the original geometry design having potential implications for comfort and safety. Regular inspections are carried out to evaluate track condition and determine whether maintenance interventions should be undertaken to correct track geometry. The dynamic measurement of track geometry parameters generates large volumes of data that must be analysed to evaluate track degradation. This work comprehensively explains how track quality is evaluated, introducing four main categories of factors affecting it. These are track design, loading, environment and maintenance. The most common techniques applied to evaluate track condition and predict degradation and faults, categorised into statistical, Machine Learning, Big Data and other, are also introduced. Specifically, the influence of each factor on track geometry is stated and the common techniques applied to each factor determined from this review. The utility of loading and maintenance data for fault prediction depend on the availability of records, whilst the impact of environmental conditions is expected to become increasingly important due to climate change. Artificial Neural Networks, Bayesian models and regression are the most applied techniques for determining track degradation behaviour and fault prediction, considering several different factors in their models. Increasingly sophisticated algorithms can consider multiple factors in tandem to predict faults based on the unique conditions of specified tracks.},

abstract={Commonly recognized as an important symbol of the tropics and global warming, the glacier loss on Mt. Kilimanjaro has received worldwide attention for decades. In this paper, we propose a high-resolution glacier-cover (GC) record of Mt. Kilimanjaro over the period from 1984 to 2020, using a novel deep learning-based semantic segmentation method and Google Earth images, as well as digital elevation model (DEM) and ERA5-Land (ERA5) for snowline and temperature variations analysis. Our method achieves an accuracy of 94.37%, which proves the model's capability to record the GC areas precisely. The results show that (1) the GC area dramatically decreases from 19.2 km2 to 3.6 km2 during 37 years, which decreases about 4% and 2% per year from 1984 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2020 respectively, (2) the snowline altitude rises from $4,651 m$ to $5,088 m$ by about $437 m$, and (3) the average $5,000 m$ air temperature on Mt. Kilimanjaro increases from −2.1 °C to −1.1 °C by about 1 °C. This study indicates that there will be no GC within a few decades if the current loss continues.},

Since then, the government continuously provides efforts to mitigate natural disasters through numerously growing researches that are inclined with the meteorological processes happening in our country. There are many researches with regards to the methods of quantifying the amount of rainfall but based on those studies, the acoustic disdrometer is rendered useless because of its inability to classify ambient noise from rain types. With this, the main purpose of this study is to develop an improved acoustic disdrometer by adding a capability in which it will categorize the intensity of the amount of rainfall from ambient noise using machine learning algorithm.

Also, the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) predictive model will be established. The obtained results show that the accuracy of the predictive model is 89.95%.},

This article has investigated the variations of potential EQ precursor in daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) before and after the 2019 Pakistan EQ from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite. The nighttime LST values of MODIS exhibit temporal anomalies during nighttime period within a time window of five days before and after the main shock day. Furthermore, the LST values predicted by artificial neural network (ANN) validate the significant enhancement in nighttime time series of MODIS. The nighttime LST anomalies obtained from the observation and ANN prediction are more than 20% and 7% of normal distribution beyond the confidence bounds, respectively, within five days after the main shock. Likewise, the ionospheric anomaly from daily total electron content (TEC) values at Sukkur Global Positioning System (GPS) station confirms the EQ associated ionospheric perturbations on the day after the main shock.

abstract={Intelligent vehicle technology has made tremendous progress due to Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Accurate behavior prediction of surrounding traffic actors is essential for the safe and secure navigation of the intelligent vehicle. Minor misbehavior of these vehicles on the busy roads may lead to an accident. Due to this, there is a need for vehicle behavior research work in today’s era. This research article reviews traffic actors’ behavior prediction techniques for intelligent vehicles to perceive, infer, and anticipate other vehicles’ intentions and future actions. It identifies the key strategies and methods for AI, emerging trends, datasets, and ongoing research issues in these fields. As per the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review dedicated to the vehicle behavior study examining existing academic literature published by peer review venues between 2011 and 2021. A systematic review was undertaken to examine these papers, and five primary research questions have been addressed. The findings show that using sophisticated input representation that includes traffic rules and road geometry, artificial intelligence-based solutions applied to behavior prediction of traffic actors for intelligent vehicles have shown promising success, particularly in complex driving scenarios. Finally, the paper summarizes the most widely used approaches in behavior prediction of traffic actors for intelligent vehicles, which the authors believe serves as a foundation for future research in behavior prediction of surrounding traffic actors for secure and accurate intelligent vehicle navigation.},

abstract={The urban heat island (UHI) effect has been widely studied because of its impacts on the environment and human’s wellbeing. The surface UHI (SUHI) is typically monitored with remote sensing products, whereas the air UHI (AUHI) is typically monitored using temperature sensor networks. The first technique requires clear days to obtain good images, and the latter is limited by the number of weather stations in an urban and rural area. An alternative to monitor the AUHI is the usage of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data which is available in all weather conditions and there are well-developed GNSS receiver networks around the world. In this article, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach to estimating the air temperature from GNSS data to take advantage of the quantity of data. By training a support vector regressor with three datasets, GNSS-derived zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD), temperature, and day-of-the year, we can estimate temperature from GNSS data without the need for other environmental variables. The regressor presented in this article is trained with data from 2016 to 2019 and tested with data from 2020 in five Japanese metropolitan areas. The results show that it is possible to predict temperature from only the ZTD of GNSS signals with high precision, as an $R^{2}$ between 0.82 and 0.90 is found for the predictions. Predicted temperatures are then used to study the diurnal cycle of the AUHI in Sapporo, Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka–Kyoto, and Fukuoka with an average precision of 0.8 °C.},

abstract={Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important greenhouse gas influencing the Earth’s climate; therefore, accurate modeling of its variability has paramount significance. In this regard, we have performed the simulation of CO2 residue (i.e., detrended depersonalized CO2) based on input of meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind), El Niño index, sea surface temperature, and normalized difference vegetation index in a machine learning (ML) model. Long-term observations available from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have been used for training and validation of ML model. The model successfully reproduced 72% of observed variability in CO2 residue with an error of 0.45 ppmv over Mauna Loa (19.54°N; −155.58°E). The cumulative temperature anomaly is found to play a key role in the simulation of CO2 residue over Mauna Loa. Evaluation reveals a reasonably good agreement between modeled and observed CO2 residue ( $R^{2} = 0.20$ –0.55 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 20%–60%) over regional sites and for global mean CO2. However, the model shows a limitation in capturing spikes likely caused by strong local influences. Inclusion of additional input parameters, representing local anthropogenic influences, is recommended to further improve the model performance over regional sites. Our study demonstrates the potential of ML modeling for the simulations of CO2 variability to complement the computationally expensive climate models.},

One of the interesting problem in climate studies to identify the homogeneous regions for trend analysis as it is rather impractical to study the time series for each measurement points. The concept of spatial clustering is applied to the TRMM satellite data to improve the classification of homogeneous rain zone.

The model performance is measured by R-square (R2) and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE). The results indicate the RF and GBDT models are both well suitable for retrieving SSA in the global ocean's interior and RF model outperforms GBDT model; the models accuracy generally decreased with the depth below 500 m. This study is helpful in understanding subsurface and deeper ocean environment response to recent global warming.},

year={2020},

pages={4689-4701},
abstract={A long time-series land surface temperature (LST) product is useful for ecological and environmental studies. However, current LST products cannot provide a global coverage at a fine spatial resolution (~100 m) over a long period (>30 years). Landsat series satellites that have been launched since 1972 provide a unique opportunity to fill the gap. Here, we proposed a single-channel framework for producing global long time-series Landsat LST retrievals on a Google earth engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. This framework unifies the LST, land surface emissivity (LSE) and atmospheric water vapor (AWV) estimation algorithms, as well as the emissivity and atmospheric input data for the Landsat LST retrievals from the entire Landsat thermal infrared image archive. In situ LST measurements and the MODIS LST products were employed to evaluate Landsat LST retrievals using the proposed framework over land and water surfaces, respectively. In total, 1317 clear-sky LST samples were collected from the Landsat 5-8 series after spatiotemporal registration with seven sites, and the average bias and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.33 and 2.01 K, respectively. Intercomparison between Landsat and MODIS LST retrievals based on 100 clear-sky scenes over 12 inland lakes showed an average bias of 0.17 K and RMSE of 1.11 K. We conclude that the proposed single-channel framework can produce Landsat LST with high accuracy following a simple yet robust way. Implementation of the single-channel method on GEE shows promise in providing the community with freely accessible and global long time-series (>30 years) LST data.},

abstract={Geospatial big data analytics has received much attention in recent years for the assessment of energy data. Globally, spatial datasets relevant to the energy field are growing rapidly every year. This research has analysed large gridded datasets of outdoor temperature, end-use energy demand, end-use energy density, population and Gros Domestic Product to end with usable inputs for energy models. These measures have been recognised as a means of informing infrastructure investment decisions with a view to reaching sustainable transition of the residential sector. However, existing assessments are currently limited by a lack of data clarifying the spatio-temporal variations within end-use energy demand. This paper presents a novel Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based methodology that uses existing GIS data to spatially and temporally assess the global energy demands in the residential sector with an emphasis on space heating. Here, we have implemented an Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML)-based approach to assess large raster datasets of 165 countries, covering 99.6% of worldwide energy users. The UML approach defines lower and upper limits (thresholds) for each raster by applying GIS-based clustering techniques. This is done by binning global high-resolution maps into re-classified raster data according to the same characteristics defined by the thresholds to estimate intranational zones with a range of attributes. The spatial attributes arise from the spatial intersection of re-classified layers. In the new zones, the energy demand is estimated, so-called energy demand zones (EDZs), capturing complexity and heterogeneity of the residential sector. EDZs are then used in energy systems modelling to assess a sustainable scenario for the long-term transition of space heating technology and it is compared with a reference scenario. This long-term heating transition is spatially resolved in zones with a range of spatial characteristics to enhance the assessment of decarbonisation pathways for technology deployment in the residential sector so that global climate targets can be more realistic met.},

abstract={The deep neural network has recently achieved promising results on cloud type classification, which gets rid of the hand-crafted features and plays an essential role in climate change analysis. Previous methods perform context reasoning with single-scale representation at the centre of the network, which is challenging to capture sufficient contextual information. In this paper, we propose a point-wise shift multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for pixel-level cloud type classification, termed PointShift, which effectively models point-wise and multi-scale neighbour information. We design a shift operation to compose a multi-scale receptive field in a non-parametric manner. Besides, we introduce split attention to improve the interaction of feature channels. Extensive experiments on the Himawari-8 image dataset demonstrate that our proposed architecture achieves the best mIoU of 71.06% and a competitive trade-off between efficiency and performance.},

abstract={Sea ice mapping in polar region is crucial for understanding the global climate change, benefiting disaster control for local community as well as providing accurate navigation for mariners. Currently, meteorological ice services in many countries manually create ice-charts, which is time-consuming work from domain experts. Machine learning and deep learning methodology can be utilized to automate ice charting, however, large amounts of reliable training data is crucial for implementing the technology successfully, and training data itself is sparse and costly to obtain in the Arctic areas. To obtain more training data, we proposed a two-stage methodology which incorporate the physics into training dataset generation procedure. Firstly, a physics-based incidence angle aware algorithm was employed for generating better connected and fewer reference classes to be manually labelled for training. Secondly, we enrich the training data to a balanced training set by using the physical knowledge regarding incidence angle dependence of SAR intensity. This many-fold enriched dataset can then be used for pixel-wise sea ice versus water classification by using a reduced UNet architecture. The primary result shows the sea-ice and water edges can be reasonably delineated by utilizing the physical based training dataset generation together with the reduced UNet architecture.},

pages={142632-142643},
abstract={Automated human pose estimation is evolving as an exciting research area in human activity detection. It includes sophisticated applications such as malpractice detection in the examination, distracted driving, gesture detection, etc., and requires robust and reliable pose estimation techniques. These applications help to map the attention of the user with head pose estimation (HPE) metrics supported by emotion and gaze analysis. This paper solves the problem of attention score estimation with HPE. The proposed method ensures ease of implementation while addressing head pose estimation using 68 facial features. Further, to attain reliability and precision, head pose estimation has been implemented as a regression task. The coordinate pair angle method (CPAM) with deep neural network (DNN) regression and elastic net regression is carried out. The use of DNN ensures precision on low lighting, distorted or occluded images. CPAM methodology leverages facial landmark detection and angular difference to estimate head pose. Experimentation results showed that the proposed model could handle large datasets, real-time data processing, significant pose variations, partial occlusions, and diverse facial expressions with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3° and less. The proposed system was evaluated on three standard databases: the 300W across large poses (300W-LP) dataset, annotated facial landmarks in the wild (AFLW2000) dataset, and the national institute of mental health child emotional faces picture set (NIMH-ChEFS) dataset. The results achieved are on par with recent state-of-the-art methodologies such as anisotropic angle distribution learning (AADL), joint head pose estimation and face alignment algorithm (JFA), rotation axis focused attention network (RAFA-Net), and propose an MAE ranging up to 6°. The paper could achieve remarkable results for attention span prediction using head pose estimation and for many possible future applications.},

abstract={Solar energy is a sustainable, clean, and free energy source used to supply heat, electricity, and even fuel and chemical energy to residential, commercial, and industrial centers. The problems associated with fossil resources and the consequences of environmental and global climate change have created good opportunities for solar energy to compete with fossil fuels, especially in countries with high radiation potential. Scientific and technical weaknesses, variations in irradiance level due to climate and seasonal changes, radiation angles, geographical location, etc., have confined the solar energy-related applications. The optimal placement of the photovoltaic (PV) power stations providing maximum performance is critical to be addressed. This study intends to empower grid-connected solar PV systems by investigating various constraints and influencing factors related to the location of solar farms. We exploit selected machine learning algorithms such as k-means, k-medoids, fuzzy c-means (FCM) methods, as well as a new proposed algorithm based on an image processing approach to optimize the system by detecting the appropriate clusters and site locations. Finally, by performing several simulations, we compare the results and the efficiency of the algorithms. Our results further designate the significant superiority of the proposed techniques.},

pages={13151-13160},
abstract={Phenology has become a field of growing importance due to the increasingly apparent impacts of climate change. However, the time-consuming, subjective and tedious nature of traditional human field observations have hindered the development of large-scale phenology networks. Such networks are rare and rely on time-lapse cameras and simplistic color indexes to monitor phenology. To automatize rapid, detailed and repeatable analyzes, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework based on machine learning and computer vision techniques. Our approach extracts multiple ecologically-relevant indicators from time-lapse digital photography datasets. The proposed framework consists of three main components: (i) a random forest model to automatically select relevant images based on color information; (ii) a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify and localize open tree buds; and (iii) a density-based spatial clustering algorithm to cluster open bud detections across the time-series. We tested this framework on a dataset including thousands of black spruce and balsam fir tree images captured using our phenological camera network. The performed experiments showed the efficiency of the proposed approach under challenging perturbation factors, such as significant image noise. Our framework is exceedingly faster and more accurate than human analysts, reducing the time-series processing time from multiple days to under an hour. The proposed methodology is particularly appropriate for large-scale and long-term analyzes of ecological imagery datasets. Our work demonstrates that the use of computer vision and machine learning methods represents a promising direction for the implementation of national, continental, or even global plant phenology networks.},

The input for both methods consists of scattering coefficient (σ°), the incidence angle (θ), sea ice salinity (S) and sea ice temperature (T). The first two variables are derived from the TDS-1 data, and the latter two are from the SMOS data. Evaluation of the proposed methods is based on measurements in 2017 and 2018 of thin sea ice with thickness less than 1 m. Comparisons showed good consistency between the derived and reference SIT, with correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.90 and root mean square differences of 5.49 cm and 7.97 cm for SVR and CNN, respectively. This demonstrates the capability of these machine learning-based methods and the utility of TDS-1 data for SIT retrieval.},

abstract={Using Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) L1 data with large amount and wide coverage, this article establishes a sea surface wind direction retrieval model based on three machine learning algorithms. Wind direction will cause the asymmetry of Delay Doppler Map (DDM). Based on this, this article extracts two angle characteristic parameters from DDM. Compared with CYGNSS full DDM, L1 compact DDM has a reduced dimension. Therefore, this article expands more characteristic parameters, including L1 parameters and geophysical parameters such as wind speed, mean sea surface pressure (MSL), sea surface temperature (SST). Wind speed, direction, MSL and SST are from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). After data preprocessing, the experimental data set is generated. Based on this data set, this article establishes support vector machine algorithm (SVM), back propagation (BP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) wind direction retrieval models and verifies their model performance and generalization performance. In addition, a filter that can optimize the accuracy of CNN model is constructed, and the retrieval effect under different wind direction intervals is further studied. The results show that the accuracy of CNN model for L1 data is higher than that of SVM and BP, and the retrieval error of global sea surface wind direction after filtering is less than 20°. The accuracy difference of different wind direction intervals also has a significant impact on the wind direction retrieval results.},

abstract={Road network extraction from remotely sensed imagery has become a powerful tool for updating geospatial databases, owing to the success of convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning semantic segmentation techniques combined with the high-resolution imagery that modern remote sensing provides. However, most CNN approaches cannot obtain high precision segmentation maps with rich details when processing high-resolution remote sensing imagery. In this study, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based deep learning approach for road segmentation from high-resolution aerial imagery. In the generative part of the presented GAN approach, we use a modified UNet model (MUNet) to obtain a high-resolution segmentation map of the road network. In combination with simple pre-processing comprising edge-preserving filtering, the proposed approach offers a significant improvement in road network segmentation compared with prior approaches. In experiments conducted on the Massachusetts road image dataset, the proposed approach achieves 91.54% precision and 92.92% recall, which correspond to a Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 91.13%, a Mean intersection over union (MIOU) of 87.43% and a F1-score of 92.20%. Comparisons demonstrate that the proposed GAN framework outperforms prior CNN-based approaches and is particularly effective in preserving edge information.},

year={2022},

pages={1-20},
abstract={Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms are an increasing threat to coastal and inland waters. These blooms can be detected using optical radiometers due to the presence of phycocyanin (PC) pigments. The spectral resolution of best-available multispectral sensors limits their ability to diagnostically detect PC in the presence of other photosynthetic pigments. To assess the role of spectral resolution in the determination of PC, a large ( $N =905$ ) database of colocated in situ radiometric spectra and PC are employed. We first examine the performance of selected widely used machine-learning (ML) models against that of benchmark algorithms for hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance ( $R_{\mathrm {rs}}$ ) spectra resampled to the spectral configuration of the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of < 6 nm. Results show that the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network applied to HICO spectral configurations (median errors < 65%) outperforms other ML models. This model is subsequently applied to $R_{\mathrm {rs}}$ spectra resampled to the band configuration of existing satellite instruments and of the one proposed for the next Landsat sensor. These results confirm that employing MLP models to estimate PC from hyperspectral data delivers tangible improvements compared with retrievals from multispectral data and benchmark algorithms (with median errors between $\sim 73$ % and 126%) and shows promise for developing a globally applicable cyanobacteria measurement approach.},

abstract={The feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) as a predictive model for thorough efficacy analysis on environmental pollution applied on mangrove forests are discussed. Mangrove forests are among the most productive and biological diverse ecosystems on the planet. However, due to environmental pollution and climate change, mangrove forests are in serious decline. Despite crucial issues pertaining mangrove forests, the law enforcement on the ecosystem is still dubious due to the lack of evidence and data that could provide accurate analysis and prediction. The main highlight of this review elaborates on pollutant markers in soil, water, and air, by correlating these three aspects to the sustainability of mangrove ecosystem. The research gap identified from this review suggests the application of an integrated environmental prediction system for practical environmental insights. A predictive model for environmental decision-making could be developed by integrating meteorological, climatological, hydrological, atmospheric, and heavy metal concentration to understand the interaction between each factor for an efficient solution of pollutant reduction scheme involving mangrove ecosystems.},

An accurate short-term forecast in terms of time and location represents a significant advantage for taking appropriate measures to prevent damage and to react and plan more efficiently. This requires a network of ground stations or remote sensing systems such as weather radar or satellites as dense as possible. In large parts of Austria, however, rough terrain limits the number of measuring stations and radar data are also only available to an insufficient extent in certain areas due to the topography. We aim to overcome these challenges by using physical data of directional radio links scattered across Austria to obtain information about the current precipitation situation. In this work, we introduce an approach for classifying rain events using a variety of different machine learning methods. The results can be used to improve numerical weather prediction models.},

abstract={The ground-based microwave radiometer (MWR) retrieves atmospheric profiles with a high temporal resolution for temperature and humidity up to a height of 10 km. Such profiles are critical for understanding the evolution of climate systems. To improve the accuracy of profile retrieval in MWR, we developed a deep learning approach called batch normalization and robust neural network (BRNN). In contrast to the traditional backpropagation neural network (BPNN), which has previously been applied for MWR profile retrieval, BRNN reduces overfitting and has a greater capacity to describe nonlinear relationships between MWR measurements and atmospheric structure information. Validation of BRNN with the radiosonde demonstrates a good retrieval capability, showing a root-mean-square error of 1.70 K for temperature, 11.72% for relative humidity (RH), and 0.256 g/m3 for water vapor density. A detailed comparison with various inversion methods (BPNN, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, ridge regression, and random forest) has also been conducted in this research, using the same training and test data sets. From the comparison, we demonstrated that BRNN significantly improves retrieval accuracy, particularly for the retrieval of temperature and RH near the surface.},

The Madeira River in Porto Velho city (Brazilian Amazon) is a good example of susceptible area to both of these factors. We take advantage of the 2014 flood, the largest recorded for this region, for combining remote sensing and geographic information system with socio, health, and infrastructure data to quantify spatially the flood impacts. Using high resolution airborne images, we applied a machine learning classification algorithm for detecting urban areas. Our results show that at the flood extent related to the highest river level at least 0.65 $\text {km}^{2}$ of urban area, 87 km of urban streets, four public schools, and two public health units were affected. More than 16 800 people suffered the impacts directly, and children represented 29.7% of them. Based on registered data, it was quantified that the city registered more than 20 cases of leptospirosis and the truck flow on the region decreased up to 92%. The spatially-explicit results of this letter are potential to guide strategies aiming to support decision-making for DRR.},

abstract={Surface soil moisture (SM) plays an essential role in the water and energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere. The published soil moisture products, having a low spatial resolution of 25–40 km, and low temporal resolution of 2–3 days, limits their applications at regional scale. In this study, the spatio-temporal resolution of Fengyun (FY) SM products was improved using a machine-learning model named the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), with the help of selected six high spatial resolution parameters, including Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Longitude (Lon) and Latitude (Lat) after gap-filled as input variables. An implements tested over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) showed that the spatio-temporal resolution of FY-3B SM was improved from 0.25° and 2–3 days to 0.05° and 1-day. The high spatio-temporal resolution SM can enhance our understanding of water-energy cycle under climate change.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) techniques can be applied to predict and monitor drought conditions due to climate change. Predicting future vegetation health indicators (such as EVI, NDVI, and LAI) is one approach to forecast drought events for hotspots (e.g. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions). Recently, ML models were implemented to predict EVI values using parameters such as land types, time series, historical vegetation indices, land surface temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration etc. In this work, we collected the MODIS atmospherically corrected surface spectral reflectance imagery with multiple vegetation related indices for modeling and evaluation of drought conditions in the MENA region. These models are built by a total of 4556 and 519 normalized samples for training and testing purposes, respectively and with 51820 samples used for model evaluation. Models such as multilinear regression, penalized regression models, support vector regression (SVR), neural network, instance-based learning K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and partial least squares were implemented to predict future values of EVI. The models show effective performance in predicting EVI values (R2> 0.95) in the testing and (R2> 0.93) in the evaluation process.},

abstract={Wildfire is one of the most frequent natural hazards across the globe, one which has cast a malevolent shroud over many communities in recent years, causing significant risk to human lives, infrastructure, and property. Wildfires are hydrogeological events which are bound to escalate, especially due to climate change. They are different from other natural hazards as they are mainly triggered by human interventions rather than natural triggers. The wildfire risk management is a complex process with many uncertainties in the assessment, fire behavior and spread modelling, and decision making. To predict wildfires, sophisticated temporal geospatial methods are required. This paper develops a wildfire probability prediction method considering the capabilities of Bayesian networks and fuzzy logic that can handle uncertainties and update probabilities in response to the availability of new data. The model takes into account the data from a geographic information system (GIS) for a specific area at micro level to estimate the wildfire probability and is able to update the probability due to any planned or unplanned changes in the area. Therefore, the proposed method can feed to future macro and micro risk-based decision-making situations in wildfire prone areas. The method is evaluated through a sensitivity analysis and its performance is investigated through a case study in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.},

Mesoscale ocean eddies have a significant impact on global warming, since they affect the ocean dynamics, the energy as well as the mass transports of ocean circulation. From satellite altimetry we can derive high-resolution, global maps containing ocean signals with dominating coherent eddy structures. The aim of this study is the development and evaluation of a deep-learning based approach for the analysis of eddies. In detail, we develop an eddy identification and tracking framework with two different approaches that are mainly based on feature learning with convolutional neural networks. Furthermore, state-of-the-art image processing tools and object tracking methods are used to support the eddy tracking. In contrast to previous methods, our framework is able to learn a representation of the data in which eddies can be detected and tracked in more objective and robust way. We show the detection and tracking results on sea level anomalies (SLA) data from the area of Australia and the East Australia current, and compare our two eddy detection and tracking approaches to identify the most robust and objective method.},

title={An Optimized Deep Neural Network Approach for Vehicular Traffic Noise Trend Modeling},
year={2021},
volume={9},

pages={107375-107386},
abstract={Vehicular traffic plays a significant role in terms of economic development; however, it is also a major source of noise pollution. Therefore, it is highly imperative to model traffic noise, especially for expressways due to their high traffic volume and speed, which produce very-high level of traffic noise. Previous traffic prediction models are mostly based on the regression approach and the artificial neural network (ANN), which often fail to describe the trends of noise. In this paper, a deep neural network-based optimization approach is implemented in two ways: i) using different algorithms for training and activation, and ii) integrating with feature selection methods such as correlation-based feature selection (CFS) and wrapper for feature-subset selection (WFS) methods. These methods are integrated to produce traffic noise maps for different time of the day on weekdays, including morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The novelty of this study is the integration of the feature selection method with the deep neural network for vehicular traffic noise modelling. New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE) in Malaysia was used as a case study due to its increasing heavy and light vehicles, and the motorbike during peak hours, which result in high traffic noise. The results from the models indicate that the WFS-DNN model has the least mean-absolute-deviation (MAD) of 2.28, and the least root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 3.97. Also, this model shows the best result compared to the other models such as DNN without integration with feature selection methods, CFS-DNN and the ANN networks (MLP and RBF). MAD improvement of 27% - 47% and RMSE improvement of 25% - 38% was achieved compared to other methods. The study provides a generic approach to key parameter selection and dimension reduction with novel trend descriptor which could be useful for future such modelling applications.},

abstract={Meeting Sustainable Development Goal 11 of making cities sustainable requires urban planning that reduces the impact of climate change and water scarcity on urban residents. Evapotranspiration (ET) in urban areas mitigates the urban heat island and controls the irrigation water demand of green spaces. In this study, we mapped the urban ET of Berlin, Germany using Sentinel-2 and open geodata, machine learning (ML), and footprint modeling in high spatial (10-m) and temporal (hourly) resolution. Footprint modeling of two urban flux towers allowed us to incorporate various land covers in training the ML models. Open remote sensing and geodata used to model urban ET includes Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, building height, impervious surface fraction, vegetation fraction, and vegetation height. Predictions were carried out using random forest regression. Daily ET was simulated for the entire city during and before a heat wave event in June 2019. Validation showed that the approach is reliable for mapping urban ET in summertime, with a mean $\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.767 and 0.488 and a mean RMSE of 0.0409 mm and 0.0242 at the more vegetated site and the city-center site, respectively. Lastly, the relationship between Land Use and Land Cover classes and daily ET was analyzed to inform sustainable urban planning.},

abstract={The study of climate change has become an important topic because of its negative impact on human life. The North-East African part lacks the studies for climate change detection, despite it being one of the most affected parts worldwide. The relationship between the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change is an important factor to understand. To investigate this linkage, we used machine-learning (ML) models based on essential climate variables (ECVs) to investigate the relationship between the GHGs and the rhythm of climate variable change. The article investigates how ML techniques can be applied to climatic data to build an ML model that is able to predict the state of climate variables for the short and long term. By selecting a candidate model, it will help in climate adaptation and mitigation, also determine at what level GHGs should be kept and their corresponding concentrations in order to avoid climate events and crises. The used models are long short-term memory, autoencoders, and convolutional neural network (CNN). Alternatively, the dataset has been selected from U.K. National Centre for Earth Observation and Copernicus Climate Change Services. We compared the performance of these techniques and the best candidate was the Head—CNN; based on performance metrics such as root-mean-squared-error: 5.378, 2.395, and 15.923, mean-absolute-error: 4.157, 1.928, and11.672, Pearson: 0.368, 0.649, and 0.291, and R2 coefficient: 0.607, 0.806, and 0.539 for the ECVs temperature, CO2, and CH4, respectively. We were able to link the GHG emission to ECVs with high accuracy based on the reading of this geographic area.},

abstract={Efficient electric machinery often needs to be accurately thermally conditioned. Heat sinks and heating surfaces frequently used to allow for precise temperature control of the critical equipment. To tackle the thermal challenges in the art, different design methodologies, such as the parametric or the topology optimization are introduced. Compared to parametric optimization, topology optimization allows for more tailored cooling solutions on elaborate geometries related to propulsion. Being based on gradient descent algorithm from the machine learning toolbox, topology optimization may suffer from local minima. In this report, the setup is designed to alleviate the risk for local minima and instead aim for a more global optimization. Accordingly, an artificial intelligence pipeline is scripted to run several gradient-descent based topology optimization assessments under a genetic algorithm optimization loop. The resulting geometry is shown to substantially improve the cooling ability in the given packaging volume in a light duty battery electric vehicle with quantified reduction in CO2 emissions.},

title={Classification and Mapping of Paddy Rice using Multi-temporal Landsat Data with a Deep Semantic Segmentation Model},
year={2021},
volume={},

pages={1-6},
abstract={As a staple commodity in major world markets, paddy rice plays an important role in various environmental issues including food security, water use, climate change, and disease transmission. Therefore, timely and accurate classification and monitoring on paddy rice are necessary for scientific and practical purposes. Precise paddy rice field maps require high spatial resolution and temporal observation frequency. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images at 500-m or 250-m spatial resolution have problems with coarse spatial resolution and mixed land cover types within a pixel. When generating annual cropping maps at large scales using multi-temporal and high spatial resolution (e.g. Landsat TM/ETM+), the problems with low temporal resolution and missing pixels(e.g. cloud cover and SLC-off data) reduce the amount of usable data. In the past, the accuracy and efficiency for paddy rice classification and mapping at fine spatial resolutions were limited by the poor data availability and traditional classification methods. Thanks to the strong ability of deep learning(DL) in feature representation, DL has been introduced into environmental remote sensing and applied in many aspects, including land cover mapping. This study aims to use a semantic segmentation model for large scale paddy rice classification based on multi-temporal Landsat data. To address the challenge of Landsat data due to low temporal resolution and inevitable cloud contamination, this research uses linear interpolation and temporal resampling to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue. The experiment was carried out in Arkansas located in the middle and lower reaches of the Mississippi River, with an area of 137,733 km2, which is the largest rice producing state in the U.S. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the deep learning model for paddy rice classification, and how various temporal intervals (7-day, 14-day and 28-day) affect the paddy rice classification performance in order to derive optimal time interval. All experiments were conducted over Arkansas’ agricultural planting areas, and a total of 63 Landsat multitemporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2016 to 2019 were used to train and test. To assess the performance of the trained model, we calculated pixel-based metrics and analysed the results by using overall accuracy (OA) and F1 score. Computational experiments show temporal resampling leads to improved classification accuracies when compared to non-resample. A good performance of the proposed model was also recorded when temporal interval was 7-day and 14-day. Compared with 6 optical spectral bands as training features, 3 bands (red, near-infrared and short-wave infrared) show notably better performance and have overall accuracy of 0.77-0.91, with the F1 score of 0.65-0.91. Overall, our results demonstrate the valuable potential of the semantic segmentation model that utilizes multi-temporal data from Landsat which allows for detailed classification and mapping of paddy rice field over large areas.},

Climate model data for monthly temperature forecasts across the United States were obtained. The data was analysed, and the relationship between the predictors (GCM Variables) and the target variable (Temperature in months) was examined using several GIS based machine learning models such as GLR, GWR, and Random Forest (RF). The best predictor model was used to estimate five-year average monthly temperatures, meaning temperature forecasts for 60 time periods. A time-series mosaic was used to mix 60 rasters for improved visualisation. R-ArcGIS Bridge was used to do analyse the functional data as well as deconstruct temporal signals into analytical fundamental functions. Thus, climate data is downscaled statistically and temperature profiles are predicted over the United States.},

abstract={Uncertainty in weather dynamics makes it important to build accurate weather prediction systems because it can save lives by better preparing people for an upcoming incidence. The aim of present research study is to present a comprehensive review of recent scientific works for short term temperature and rainfall prediction on both local and global spatial scale. The literature shows that some meteorological factors like Atmospheric pressure, precipitation, dew point temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure, cloud cover, snowfall, humidity, wind velocity and wind direction are potential measures to predict future temperature and rainfall. We focused on recent applications of machine learning and deep learning models like Deep Echo State Network, recurrent neural network, convolutional recurrent neural network, and graph convolutional network, Autoencoders, Multi layer Perceptron and Long short-term memory. Applications of multimodal learning, reservoir computing and multitask learning have shown noticeable enhancement in the prediction accuracy of other state of art the models. Fine capability of CNN to extract suitable patterns from numeric weather data is also reported. The time interval of data recording also affects the prediction accuracy greatly. More frequently recorded input data worked better than less frequently recorded data. The use of electromagnetic sensors instead of satellite and radar setups is reliable as well as cost effective for collecting data for prediction. Evaluation indices related to hit rate of rainfall and no rainfall, caching rate, overlooking rate and Swing-and-miss rate can be considered as statistical measures along with other statistical metrics in case of rainfall prediction.},

However, automatic building extraction with non-noisy segmentation map and obtaining accurate boundary information is a big challenge for most of the popular deep learning methods due to the existence of some barriers like cars, vegetation cover and shadow of trees in the high-resolution remote sensing imagery. Thus, we introduce an end-to-end convolutional neural network called Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in this study to tackle these issues. In the generative model, we utilized SegNet model with Bi-directional Convolutional LSTM (BConvLSTM) to generate the segmentation map from Massachusetts building dataset containing high-resolution aerial imagery. BConvLSTM combines encoded features (containing of more local information) and decoded features (containing of more semantic information) to improve the performance of the model even with the presence of complex backgrounds and barriers. The adversarial training method enforces long-range spatial label vicinity to tackle with the issue of covering building objects with the existing occlusions such as trees, cars and shadows and achieve high-quality building segmentation outcomes under the complex areas. The quantitative results obtained by the proposed technique with an average F1-score of 96.81% show that the suggested approach could achieve better results through detecting and adjusting the difference between the segmentation model output and the reference map compared to other state-of-the-art approaches such as autoencoder method with 91.36%, SegNet+BConvLSTM with 95.96%, FCN-CRFs with 95.36%% SegNet with 94.77%, and GAN-SCA model with 96.36% accuracy.},

year={2022},

pages={1-15},
abstract={Existing automated road extraction approaches concentrate on regional accuracy rather than road shape and connectivity quality. Most of these techniques produce discontinuous outputs caused by obstacles, such as shadows, buildings, and vehicles. This study proposes a shape and connectivity-preserving road identification deep learning-based architecture called SC-RoadDeepNet to overcome the discontinuous results and the quality of road shape and connectivity. The proposed model comprises a state-of-the-art deep learning-based network, namely, the recurrent residual convolutional neural network, boundary learning (BL), and a new measure based on the intersection of segmentation masks and their (morphological) skeleton called connectivity-preserving centerline Dice (CP_clDice). The recurrent residual convolutional layers accumulate low-level features for segmentation tasks, thus allowing for better feature representation. Such representation enables us to construct a UNet network with the same number of network parameters but improved segmentation effectiveness. BL also aids the model in improving the road’s boundaries by penalizing boundary misclassification and fine-tuning the road form. Furthermore, the CP_clDice method aids the model in maintaining road connectivity and obtaining accurate segmentations. We demonstrate that CP_clDice ensures connection preservation for binary segmentation, thereby allowing for efficient road network extraction at the end. The proposed model improves F1 score accuracy to 5.49%, 4.03%, 3.42%, and 2.27% compared with other comparative models, such as LinkNet, ResUNet, UNet, and VNet, respectively. Furthermore, qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrate that the proposed SC-RoadDeepNet can improve road extraction by tackling shadow and occlusion-related interruptions. These assessments can also produce high-resolution results, particularly in the area of road network completeness.},

abstract={Iris biometric identification allows for contactless authentication, which helps to avoid the transmission of diseases like COVID-19. Biometric systems become unstable and hazardous due to spoofing attacks involving contact lenses, replayed video, cadaver iris, synthetic Iris, and printed iris. This work demonstrates the iris presentation attacks detection (Iris- PAD) approach that uses fragmental coefficients of transform iris images as features obtained using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Haar Transform, and hybrid Transform. In experimental validations of the proposed method, three main types of feature creation are investigated. The extracted features are utilized for training seven different machine learning classifiers alias Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and decision tree(J48) with ensembles of SVM+RF+NB, SVM+RF+RT, and RF+SVM+MLP (multi-layer perceptron) for proposed iris liveness detection. The proposed iris liveness detection variants are evaluated using various statistical measures: accuracy, Attack Presentation Classification Error Rate (APCER), Normal Presentation Classification Error Rate (NPCER), Average Classification Error Rate (ACER). Six standard datasets are used in the investigations. Total nine iris spoofing attacks are getting identified in the proposed method. Among all investigated variations of proposed iris-PAD methods, the 4 $\times4$ of fragmental coefficients of a Hybrid transformed iris image with RF algorithm have shown superior iris liveness detection with 99.95% accuracy. The proposed hybridization of transform for features extraction has demonstrated the ability to identify all nine types of iris spoofing attacks and proved it robust. The proposed method offers exceptional performances against the Synthetic iris spoofing images by using a random forest classifier. Machine learning has massive potential in a similar domain and could be explored further based on the research requirements.},

Long time series of and spatio-temporal continuous soil moisture is of great importance to meteorological and hydrological applications, such as weather forecasting, global change and drought monitoring. In this study, the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture product of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2002 to 2015 was reconstructed using the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) based on reconstructed MODIS products, i.e., LST, NDVI, and Albedo. Results show that the ECV soil moisture could be well reconstructed with R2 higher than 0.71, RMSE less than 0.05 cm3 cm-3 and absolute Bias less than 0.03 cm3 cm-3 for both grids of 0.25°×0.25° and 1°×1°, compared with the in-situ measurements in 2012 over the TP. The reconstructed long time series of and spatio-temporal continuous soil moisture could be valuable in hydrometeorological studies of the TP.},

abstract={Machine learning and complex network theory have emerged as crucial tools to extract meaningful information from big data, especially those related to complex systems. In this work, we aim to combine them to analyze El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases. This non-linear phenomenon consists of anomalous (de)increase of temperature at the tropical Pacific Ocean, which has irregular occurrence and causes climatic variability worldwide. We construct temporal Climate Networks from the Surface Air Temperature time-series and calculate network metrics to characterize the warm and cold ENSO episodes. The metrics are used as topological features for classification. We employ ten classifiers and achieved 80% AUC ROC when predicting the intensity of Strong/ Weak El Niño and Strong/Weak La Niña for the next season. The complex network represents the relationship among different regions of the planet and machine learning creates models to classify the different classes of ENSO. This work opens new paths of research by integrating network science and machine learning to analyze complex data like global climate systems.},

abstract={In the last few years we have been witnessing with stupefaction the intensification of the majority of meteorological phenomena as a direct consequence of the global warming of the planet. The latter, occupies a preponderant place in scientific research, to define with precision its present and future repercussions on human life. For this purpose, a continuous and real-time monitoring of the physical quantities characterizing meteorological phenomena is necessary for their good understanding as well as their early detection and the triggering of alarms during emergency situations. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the development of an intelligent electronic sentinel, which will be able to collect, process environmental data to detect those meteorological phenomena that form in its direct vicinity. In this respect, our electronic sentinel will rely on artificial intelligence to enrich these knowledge bases and ensure the veracity of the phenomena it quantifies by avoiding triggering false alarms.},

title={Tropospheric delays derived from ground meteorological parameters: comparison between machine learning and empirical model approaches},
year={2020},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-10},
abstract={High spatio-temporal variability of atmospheric water vapor is directly reflected in the tropospheric pathdelays that microwave satellite signals experience. The so-called zenith total delays (ZTDs) need to be estimated in case of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Usually, models describe the ZTD with three meteorological parameters measured on ground: pressure, temperature and partial water vapor pressure. However, these models are determined empirically and it is especially a struggle to accurately determine the delay caused by the water vapor (wet delay) from meteorological data. In this work, we provide an alternative approach of estimating the tropospheric path delay using machine learning (ML) algorithms. During the last two decades machine learning algorithms have become widely used in many fields of science and engineering. Therefore, a large amount of time series of ZTDs and meteorological data and the successful applicability of machine learning to various applications are the main motivation behind this work. Besides, we also investigated another approach to compute ZTDs, based on the well-known Saastamoinen model [Saastamoinen, 1973], after interpolating the meteorological parameters at GNSS sites. The idea behind this work is to genarate GNSS zenith pathdelays without processing any GNSS data, but only using meteorological parameters. Therefore, GNSS zenith pathdelays from 72 permanent stations in Switzerland and meteorological data from the permanent SwissMetNet network (with over 120 stations) have been used for training and validation for a period of 11 years. The distribution of the sites all over Switzerland allows the network to be trained and validated with stations at different altitudes and with various meteorological conditions. The ML approach showed an overall accuracy of 1.6 cm in terms of standard deviation, with almost no bias. Moreover, results show that stations at higher altitudes can benefit more from this approach. Compared to the Saastamoinen model, it had an overall improvement of about 20%, with a much better estimation in summer periods, when the amount of water vapor is higher. This work is a contribution to using ML algorithms to compensate for atmospheric errors in GNSS signals, and to compare its capabilities with empirically derived models.},

abstract={Passive microwave remote sensing can effectively capture the near-surface soil freeze/thaw onsets. Accurately understanding the transition of permafrost freeze/thaw state is helpful for us to respond to climate change in time. In order to improve the retrieval accuracy of freeze/thaw onsets, we propose an XGBoost modeling method that combines SMAP and AMSR2 for freeze/thaw onsets detection. We conducted experiments using data covering Alaska from 2015 to 2020 to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed model was applied to the whole study area to obtain the spatial and temporal distribution of freezing periods. During the study period, the shortening of the freezing period has been most evident in 2018–2019. The variation of the freezing period is related to climate anomalies.},

pages={2557-2570},
abstract={Random forests (RFs), an advanced machine learning (ML) method, was used here to develop a robust and rapid quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs) algorithm for the new-generation geostationary satellite of Himawari-8. In this algorithm, the global precipitation measurement (GPM) product has been employed to train QPE prediction model. The real-time multiband infrared brightness temperature from Himawari-8, combined with the spatiotemporally matched numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the global forecast system, have been used as predictor variables for QPE. Among the variables used in RF learning model, total precipitable water and $K$ -index from NWP data have the highest rankings, indicating the importance of atmospheric environment for QPE. To enhance the accuracy of RF models or to optimize model training, a sample-balance technique has been utilized to adjust the ratios of samples in nonprecipitation/precipitation classification and quantitative precipitation regression data sets. Further sensitivity and validation analyses help determine the optimal RF classification and regression models for predicting nonprecipitation/precipitation pixel and rain rate. The selected RF classification model is found to predict precipitation area with an accuracy of 0.87. For predicted QPE product, the mean-absolute-error and root-mean-square error of RF regression model are 0.51 and 2.0 mm/h, respectively. Overall, the RF ML algorithm has a higher detection rate over homogenous ocean surface as compared with over land. Meanwhile, this RF algorithm tends to underestimate rain rate, especially in the presence of heavy rainfall. Despite this, it still produces a reasonable pattern of rainfall area and intensity, which are highly consistent with GPM observations.},

abstract={Every year, the wildfires ravage broad areas of natural forest and nearby regions, causing substantial financial and life losses and deteriorating the air quality. More air hazards are emitted to the atmosphere reaching as high as the stratosphere propagating through the air currents. With the aggravation of climate change, wildfires of either human or natural cause could become more ferocious and devastating. A feasible solution is to detect the wildfire and respond early before the fire spread becomes irreversible. Satellite imagery serves as a cost-effective means to update near-real-time holistic landscape views of land and sea over extended periods. Such an advantage makes early fire detection and warning even in remote areas possible. The rendered images provided by the satellites’ various instruments incorporate various channels to provide real and artificial colors to reveal landscape details imperceptible to the naked eyes. This imagery dataset discussed in this paper derives from NASA’s Aqua and Terra satellites and make available at the NASA-IMPACT data share repository [1]. The dataset totals 704 images of cropped frames and their labeled images taken during both satellites’ extensive flyby observations. The images also contain spatial-temporal information serving as relevant metadata for analysis. This paper provides a survey of the recent advances in neural network-based object detection techniques followed by machine learning and deep learning-based methods to detect and localize smoke. A comprehensive elaboration of the datasets follows the method overview.},

abstract={Despite the recent advances in satellite-based L-band microwave radiometry and retrieval algorithms to provide a unique capability to measure sea surface salinity (SSS) from space and explore its utility for understanding mesoscale dynamics, global ocean circulation, vertical mixing, evaporation rates and climate oscillations, SSS retrieval from L-band microwave radiometric data from the NASA-SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission is often biased with systematic errors on larger temporal, spatial scales and random errors on short-time and length scales. To improve the SSS retrieval from SMAP data, we developed a robust algorithm based on a machine-learning approach with high-resolution in-situ data from the Ocean Moored Buoy Network in the Northern Indian Ocean (OMNI), which includes the Arabian Sea (AS) and Bay of Bengal (BoB). The new algorithm was rigorously trained, tested and validated using the in-situ SSS time series measurements from the AS and BoB. Several sensitive variables were examined and used to improve the SSS estimates – such as radiometric and ancillary data from the satellite observations, sea-surface wind and precipitation from the ERA5 data, and SSS/ SST from the OMNI buoy measurements. The OMNI time-series measurements provided the spatially averaged satellite products to characterize the variability and gross features of SSS in BoB and AS waters on weekly, monthly, seasonal and annual time scales. The systematic validation of SMAP SSS products on a range of spatio-temporal scales showed that the new algorithm improved the SSS estimates by more than 15% in open ocean waters and 25% in river-discharge and precipitation-dominated regions in BoB and AS, when compared to the standard (operational) algorithm. Further analysis demonstrated that the new algorithm reduced clear biases and significant anomalies in SMAP SSS retrievals in the regions of river runoff, surface-freshened ocean and intense tropical cyclones, and captured synoptic/mesoscale SSS features and their seasonal variations in the North Indian Ocean.},

abstract={Snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE) are significant parameters in climate and hydrologic models. Successful estimation of SD (SWE) can improve the accuracy of snowmelt-runoff predictions and the management of water supplies. Currently, passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing is the most efficient way to monitor SD on global and regional scales; however, there are many challenges for accurate SD estimation. In this study, a new spatial dynamic method is developed by introducing random forest (RF) model, AMSR-2 TB and other auxiliary data. The main objective of this work is to produce long term SD dataset with the dynamic method using the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI/S) which span from 1987 to present. Through evaluation and analysis, the RF method performs better than traditional linear-fitting model. However, it tends to overestimate SD in shallow snow cover areas. Now, a preliminary spatial dynamic method (pixel-based model) is developed. For further work, the evaluation will be conducted to assess the feasibility of SD reconstruction. Moreover, to address overestimation over shallow snow areas, the snow depletion curve (SDC) incorporating SD and fractional snow cover (FSC) is expected to improve SD retrievals.},

abstract={Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is the world's largest mangrove forest covers an area of about 3,900 sq. mi, of which forests in Bangladesh extend over 2,323 sq. mi and in India, they extend over 1,640 sq. mi. The Sundarbans is called the shelter of Bangladesh as it protects southern coastal regions from natural disasters such as Cyclones, and typhoons. However, the mighty Sundarbans are dying because of climate changes, excessive human activities and the overwhelming consumption of natural forest resources. The primary objective of this study is to classify and detect deforested areas due to natural and anthropogenic causes. This study used Sentinel 2A Imageries of year 2016 & 2022 to detect forest cover changes in between the time period. In this study, the transfer learning method was applied to classify deforested areas. The transfer learning method uses the knowledge of a pre-trained model to build the new model. The UNet was the base model where weight from the pre-trained ResNet34 model trained on the ImageNet dataset (https://www.image-net.org/) was used as the backend. The dataset was divided into two sets where 80% of data was used in training and 20% was used for model validation. Average training and validation accuracy for both 2016 and 2022 data were close to 98%. The predicted images and ground truth data were similar and the model captured rivers, deforested areas, and vegetation approximately. We found that there were 1426.71 sq. mi of forest covers in the year-2016 which reduced to 1394.26 sq. mi in 2022 (3.5% of total area). This study also found interesting information about natural reforestation. We found that between 2016–2022, 56.89 sq. mi of forest cover was deforested whereas 24.44 sq. mi of deforested land cover was converted back into forest cover. The outcome of this study can guide the policy makers to identify areas where rapid deforestation is happing and can help to implement policies to protect those areas.},

In this context, full-waveform airborne topo-bathymetric lidar is a reliable tool to collect data seamlessly over land-water continuum zones, thanks to its dual wavelength configuration. It is therefore optimal for coastal habitats monitoring and mapping. However, lidar waveform processing often relies on peak detection and feature extraction that are difficult to conFigure and often sensitive to noise. In this article, we rather suggest not to rely on hand-crafted features by relying on U-time, a neural network inspired by the well-known UNet convolutional neural network, to identify peaks in waveforms and classify them to discriminate coastal ecosystems efficiently. The network is tested on green waveforms and we evaluate in addition the contribution of infrared intensities. Results show equivalent performances, and obtain over 92% of accuracy when accepting a 2 samples margin of error for peaks location, which does not impact heavily waveform analysis, considering usual peaks widths. Our study shows green waveforms alone allow habitats detection with a F-score of 94%, outperforming previous methods.},

abstract={Understanding the suitability of agricultural land for applying specific management practices is of great importance for sustainable and resilient agriculture against climate change. Recent developments in the field of causal machine learning enable the estimation of intervention impacts on an outcome of interest, for samples described by a set of observed characteristics. We introduce an extensible data-driven framework that leverages earth observations and frames agricultural land suitability as a geospatial impact assessment problem, where the estimated effects of agricultural practices on agroecosystems serve as a land suitability score and guide decision making. We formulate this as a causal machine learning task and discuss how this approach can be used for agricultural planning in a changing climate. Specifically, we extract the agricultural management practices of "crop rotation" and "landscape crop diversity" from crop type maps, account for climate and land use data, and use double machine learning to estimate their heterogeneous effect on Net Primary Productivity (NPP), within the Flanders region of Belgium from 2010 to 2020. We find that the effect of crop rotation was insignificant, while landscape crop diversity had a small negative effect on NPP. Finally, we observe considerable effect heterogeneity in space for both practices and analyze it.},

year={2022},
volume={60},
number={},
pages={1-12},
abstract={Estimating precipitable water vapor (PWV) with high accuracy and spatial resolution is important in many disciplines. Water vapor absorption and non-absorption channels can be observed in the near-infrared (NIR) ray of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which can be used to retrieve PWV. However, traditional algorithms overestimate the NIR PWV in North America. This study proposes a novel NIR retrieval algorithm based on machine learning that considers land-cover types to estimate high-accuracy PWV. To do this, nonlinear models between MODIS NIR transmittance, based on the two-and three-channel ratio, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) PWV, recorded by the SuomiNet GNSS network, are established using a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). Verification shows that the root mean square error (RMSE)/standard deviation (STD)/bias of the two-channel ratio PWV is 1.29/1.29/0.02 mm, respectively, and the improvements of RMSE and STD are 66.32% and 37.98%, respectively. The RMSE/STD/bias values of the three-channel ratio PWV are 1.29/1.29/0.02 mm, respectively, and the improvements in RMSE and STD are 68.67% and 42.31%, respectively. In addition, the surface verification of the proposed method in six land-cover types shows that both the two-and three-channel ratio methods can yield satisfactory PWV estimates. Compared with the MODIS PWV products, the proposed method yields remarkable progress.},

To study the potential of AI in tackling climate change, we analyze the performance of four probabilistic machine learning methods in forecasting sea-ice extent for lead times of up to 6 months, further comparing them with traditional machine learning methods. Our comparative analysis shows that Gaussian Process Regression is a good fit to predict sea-ice extent for longer lead times with lowest RMSE score.},

year={2019},

pages={403-408},
abstract={Different types of land covers on the earth surface have different thermal characteristics and respond to solar heating and radiation cooling differently. Further the land covers emit heat in proportion to their respective temperatures and hence influence the air temperature differently. Therefore information about distribution and extent of various types of land covers along-with corresponding temperature has become important for environmental studies. Physical measurement of various land cover type or surface temperature at every place is not feasible. Fortunately advent of the remote sensing technology has considerably replaced the conventional ground surveys for a variety of data collection needs and providing even more precise data. The earth surface temperature estimates are now being derived from remotely captured data in thermal infrared band of the electromagnetic spectrum whereas land cover information is derived primarily from visible and near infrared bands. A time series data is taken mostly for three seasons of each year including spring, summer and post monsoon seasons to capture the seasonal variations and derive inclusive Land-use Land cover estimates on a five year periodicity since 1993. The time series LULC data is important for studying the correlation with the environment heating trends in the National Capital Territory and its contribution in the global warming. It would provide important inputs to the decision makers and other stake holders of NCT Delhi to set desired environmental standards and consider land-use planning to achieve the same in a conscious manner. As commonly believed, the study shows increase in the built up area at the expanse of vegetation cover. This work also redefines the approach of deriving `Land use Land cover' from the Remote Sensing viewpoint to examine large scale real-spatial datasets.},

abstract={Terrestrial surface soil heat flux is an important component of surface energy balance, uncertainty in surface soil heat flux may cause errors in evapotranspiration estimation when using energy balance-based algorithms at large scale using remote sensing observations. This study assessed the performance of different equations for daily averaged soil heat flux estimation for large-scale application using parameters derived from remote sensing observations, including five soil heat flux equations used in different evapotranspiration models and three machine learning-based soil heat flux algorithms. These algorithms, taking soil heat flux as a constant or varying fraction of net radiation, generally overestimate daily soil heat flux with root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.90 ~ 23.12 W m-2. The machine learning methods could achieve better accuracy of daily soil heat flux estimation, with the lowest RMSE of 3.85 W m-2 by random forest algorithm based on in situ observations at flux tower sites. The random forest algorithm was further applied for global soil heat flux estimation, and the obtained soil heat flux could capture the global patterns of soil heat flux well with RMSE of 4.77 W m-2. The results indicate that soil heat flux could be well estimated by the machine learning method, and it is promising to improve regional evapotranspiration estimation based on remote sensing observations.},

However, the solar radiation is measured by a few weather stations in a few locations. The aim of this paper is to reconstruct the hourly solar global radiation trend on a year in some cities of the Northern and Southern Italy, starting from typical recorded meteorological data: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, etc. For this task a supervised machine learning algorithm has been used to build a model. The reached results show that the solar radiation hourly values can be extrapolated from other weather data in a reliable way, in fact an f-measure ranging from 0.950 an 1 is obtained for the several Italian cities involved in the experiment.},

abstract={Precipitation is the critical components in the hydrological cycle over the Earth. Accurate and reliable high-resolution precipitation nowcasting with up to two hours ahead is a strong demand for many sectors that make decisions based on weather forecast. Due to the complexity of atmosphere, precipitation prediction is a long standing scientific challenge with direct impact on social and economic departments throughout the world. Numerical Weather Prediction(NWP) is the most common approach to provide people with weather information in near future based on the simulation of atmospheric dynamics based on physical laws, which usually comes across the “spin-up” problem and is hard to make full use of tremendous amount of Earth observation data that increase quickly as more and more observation instruments are being deployed around the world. The machine learning (ML) networks (DNN) witnessed remarkable progress in recent years due to increased amounts of available data, better model architectures and ease of implementation on powerful specialized hardware such as GPU and TPUs (Sφnderby 2020; Jouppi et al., 2017). Recently the DNN is now able to effectively process large time series spatial and temporal input data. Up on these developments of ML and hardware, we introduce China Artificial Intelligence Nowcasting system(CAINS) based on a deep learning model for precipitation nowcasting over China. As shown in Figure 1, at least 8 temporally continuous radar observed images are needed to drive CAINS to produce 60 (six-hour) precipitation images. Figure 2 shows the 6-hour precipitation nowcasting results with initial time at 20210513(Beijing time, BJT) 08:00. Figure 3 show the performance of nowcasting results by CAINS and Optical Flow(OF) algorithm in terms of Probability Of Detection (POD), Critical Success Index (CSI), and Equitable Threat Score(ETS). It is noted that CAINS outperform OF with pronouncedly better skills.},

abstract={The oil refining industry is considered one of the largest energy-consuming industrial sectors worldwide and the third-largest global source of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, increasingly restrictive environmental quality specifications for oil products worldwide require increased use of energy during the distillation process, further increasing the emissions. Therefore, energy usage reduction could help in two ways: to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions and maximize the profits of the oil refining plants. The development and use of soft sensors to monitor the crude refining process in real-time enables timely insights and decision-making to ensure the products meet the required quality. Furthermore, the same approach can be used to further optimize the energy consumption over the multiple stages of the refining process. In this paper, we address the problem of predicting the energy consumption in a crude oil refinery. We do so on a real-world use case, with data obtained from a Tüpras refinery. We found the best performance was achieved with a CatBoost regressor when performing a tenfold cross-validation and assessing their significance against other models when comparing confidence intervals at a 95% level of significance.},

abstract={Previous studies on short-term rainfall forecast using precipitable water vapor (PWV) and meteorological parameters mainly focus on rain occurrence, while the rainfall forecast is rarely investigated. Therefore, an hourly rainfall forecast (HRF) model based on a supervised learning algorithm is proposed in this study to predict rainfall with high accuracy and time resolution. Hourly PWV derived from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and temperature data are used as input parameters of the HRF model, and a support vector machine is introduced to train the proposed model. In addition, this model also considers the time autocorrelation of rainfall in the previous epoch. Hourly PWV data of 21 GNSS stations and collocated meteorological parameters (temperature and rainfall) for five years in Taiwan Province are selected to validate the proposed model. Internal and external validation experiments have been performed under the cases of slight, moderate, and heavy rainfall. Average root-mean-square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE of the proposed HRF model are 1.36/1.39 mm/h and 1.00/0.67, respectively. In addition, the proposed HRF model is compared with the similar works in previous studies. Compared results reveal the satisfactory performance and superiority of the proposed HRF model in terms of time resolution and forecast accuracy.},
