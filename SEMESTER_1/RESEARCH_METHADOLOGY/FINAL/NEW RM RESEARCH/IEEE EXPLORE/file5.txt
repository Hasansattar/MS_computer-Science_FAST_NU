abstract={Topo-bathymetric lidar is a powerful tool to survey coastal ecosystems while ensuring data continuity between land and water regardless of the nature of the terrain, and allowing the collection of information up to several dozens of metres deep. This study analyzes the potential of full waveform lidar data to monitor key ecosystems for climate change mitigation: seagrasses. It proposes an original way of processing topo-bathymetric lidar waveforms to map their spatial repartition and extent in Corsica (France). Waveform statistical and shape parameters are computed and used to produce a map of seagrass meadows that reaches over 86% of overall accuracy. Seagrass height is also extracted, offering perspectives for structural complexity assessment and ecosystem services quantification.},

abstract={Today, weather changes can't be predicted due to extraordinary events due to global warming. One of the effects of climate change has led to the proliferation of tropical cyclone events on Earth. In facilitating the process of classification of tropical cyclone intensity, a machine learning based system was created. The algorithm used in the feature extraction process is GLCM while in the classification process is SVM. First of all, the infrared image recognition process is done by extracting 14 GLCM features in the RGB, Ycbcr and Grayscale color spaces. Next, a combination of 3, 4 and 5 features is carried out before entering the classification stage. At each stage of SVM classification testing with OAO and OAA coding design will also be tested with the use of Gaussian, Linear and Polynomial kernels including the influence of 3, 4 and 5 GLCM combination features to see the effect on the results of accuracy. From this testing process, the system can be used to classify tropical cyclone intensity in the form of infrared images with an accuracy rate of 88% which corresponds to the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale.},

abstract={Climate change issues are continuously on the rise and the need to build models and software systems for management of natural disasters such as cyclones is increasing. Cyclone wind-intensity prediction looks into efficient models to forecast the wind-intensification in tropical cyclones which can be used as a means of taking precautionary measures. If the wind-intensity is determined with high precision a few hours prior, evacuation and further precautionary measures can take place. Neural networks have become popular as efficient tools for forecasting. Recent work in neuro-evolution of Elman recurrent neural network showed promising performance for benchmark problems. This paper employs Cooperative Coevolution method for training Elman recurrent neural networks for Cyclone wind-intensity prediction in the South Pacific region. The results show very promising performance in terms of prediction using different parameters in time series data reconstruction.},

abstract={Abundant floods and cyclones are the major cause of large emergency and acute ruin of properties in various countries. Usually floods are acknowledged as one of the most crucial problem in Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh and France etc. Diverse techniques were carried out for a robust prediction system to investigate the flash floods. A dynamic system for the identification of run offs involves the computation of water peak, rainfall velocity, Global Positioning System-Precipitable Water Vapor (GPS PWV), wind speed, orientation, complex levels of river, land humidity, oceanic basement pressure and flash flood color with authentic cognizance algorithms. Accurate and precise forecasting of floods is very complex as it depends on many factors like precipitation, cloud to ground flashes, geomagnetic field, color of water, wind velocity, wind direction, temperature and others. In this research paper classification approaches like Linear Support vector machine, Quadratic Support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor and Linear discriminant analysis have been implemented to classify the true positive event of flash floods accurately and precisely. Comparative analysis has been performed between these three algorithms to determine the highest accuracy algorithm. Parametric comparison and results of training and testing proved that Support Vector Machine (SVM) performed very well.},

abstract={Understanding deforestation drivers is important for climate change mitigation, forest management and effective control measures. Charcoal production is thought to be one of the main drivers of forest degradation in many Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) regions. Due to the difficulty to detect it, the industry impact is highly uncertain. In this paper we explore means to improve the understanding of forest degradation due to charcoal production in SSA by leveraging the capacity for large area systematic observation of Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. We utilise Sentinel-1 SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) time series data to distinguish charcoal production patterns at regional scale. We compare different statistical and Machine Learning approaches. The results indicate that Deep Learning methods give the best performance in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving just under 90% accuracy over test and validation areas. Future work looks to generalize the analysis and extend to country level characterization of degradation.},

abstract={The more frequent meteorological anomalies and climate changes push us to consider green sustainable energy as a chance to slow down such issues. Thus, we should introspect the correlations between indicators over time and understand the underneath of their meaning. Large volumes of data regarding energy are provided by Eurostat and other official data sources that require data analytics to extract valuable insights from energy indicators and indices to better understand the dynamics towards a green energy transition of the European Union State Members (EU-SM). In this paper, we analyze several energy indicators calculated for a 12-year time span with statistics and machine learning techniques, such as an unsupervised clustering algorithm with Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Grouping the EU-SM by energy indicators from the beginning years to the end of the analyzed interval reveals differences and similarities in their efforts, shifted trends, influencing power and tendencies towards a green energy transition. The results of our analyses can be further used to assess the efficiency of stimuli for green energy generation and improve the policymakers’ strategies.},

abstract={Detailed information on the spatial and temporal distribution of active layer thickness (ALT) throughout the North Slope of Alaska, were it available, could offer valuable insights into the effects of climate change throughout the region and facilitate the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from permafrost degradation. We are, therefore, developing extensive high-resolution maps of ALT on the North Slope of Alaska. To do this, we use a machine learning algorithm to extrapolate ALT from high resolution strips of estimated ALT derived from airborne P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquired over two sets of flights in each of three different years. Our results indicate upscaling root-mean-square error (RMSE) of about 4 cm relative to thousands of randomly-selected SAR-derived ALT validation samples, and RMSE of approximately 10 cm relative to a small number of in-situ ALT measurements.},

abstract={Inertial navigation system (INS) is widely equipped in various vehicles for overcoming GPS-challenging environments. The thermal-magnetic coupling heading-effect drift (thermal-magnetic drift) of INS is a multi-physics coupling error related to carrier maneuver, which cannot be compensated well by traditional methods. In this paper, the source of gyro thermal-magnetic drift are analyzed and an Ensemble Learning (EL) and Sage-Husa adaptive Kalman filter (SHAKF) based integration scheme for the thermal-magnetic drift compensation in high-grade INS is established. In the integrated system, the geomagnetic field strength calculated by International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model and temperature information measured by sensors are selected as input of the thermal-magnetic drift prediction model. The gyro biases estimated by exponential fading SHAKF are taken as target in training phase. The EL algorithms, LSBoost and Bagging, are used for training when GPS data is available. The gyro thermal-magnetic drift is predicted and compensated by the trained model during GPS outages. Land and sea tests show its effectiveness on compensate the gyro thermal-magnetic drift of the proposed method.},

abstract={Urbanization is accelerating at a rapid rate, which has introduced many challenges, especially in the field of urban planning. Under the backdrop of global urbanization, some cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters that are influenced by unplanned urban expansion. Rational planning of urban functional areas needs to be strengthened to improve the scientific approach of urban planning and urbanization. In this study, the classification of urban functional areas based on dual-modal data (i.e., remote sensing image and user behavior data) was implemented using machine learning (ML) algorithms. After the set test, the classification accuracy of urban functional areas reached 82.45%. Through analysis, it could be concluded that the use of data of two modalities achieved a higher classification accuracy than that achieved by using data of a single modality. The data of the two modalities complement each other, and the use of ML algorithms to train such data can yield good results.},

Studying the changes in its water areas is of great significance to the ecological security of the North China Plain. This study uses TM image data, based on the MNDWI water body index method, combined with the IWZ threshold segmentation method, to extract the water distribution range of Baiyangdian from 1992 to 2018. On this basis, the characteristics of time and spatial change of Baiyangdian are analyzed, and the correlation between water area change and water fragmentation is analyzed, and the main conclusions are as follows:(1) From 1992 to 2018, the water area of Baiyangdian presents a trend of more in the beginning and end years and less in the middle years, and the overall curve fluctuates greatly. (2) The degree of fragmentation is inversely proportional to the water area. (3) The accumulated water storage space of Baiyangdian increased from the outside to the inside overall, and the core water storage area is dispersed and distributed.},

title={Retrieval of Atmospheric Aerosol Optical Depth From AVHRR Over Land With Global Coverage Using Machine Learning Method},
year={2022},
volume={60},
number={},
pages={1-12},
abstract={Aerosols play an important role in global climate change, which requires long-term data records. Advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) provides continuous observations for up to 40 years since 1979, which makes it worthwhile to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) from AVHRR over land. A novel algorithm for retrieving AOD from AVHRR is developed based on the machine learning (ML) method. The AVHRR observations from pathfinder atmospheres–extended (PATMOS-x) Level-2 dataset and corresponding AOD products ( $0.55~\mu \mathrm {m}$ ) from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in 2014 are used as training data. And AOD products in three years (2015, 2006, and 1998) named AVHRR XGB-AOD were generated for evaluation. Comparisons show that the AVHRR XGB-AOD is consistent with the MODIS AOD with correlation coefficients greater than 0.80 and RMSE less than 0.18 for most months in 2015 and 2006. The temporal and spatial characteristics from AVHRR XGB-AOD are similar to those from the MODIS AOD, but those from the previous AVHRR AOD with deep blue (DB) algorithm are significantly different. Validation with AERONET indicates that more than 68% of the matchups fall within expected error [EE, ±( $0.05\,\,\pm \,\,0.25\times {\mathrm {AOD}}_{\mathrm {AERONET}}\mathrm {)] }$ in 2015 and 2006, while the fraction is 66% in 1998. Compared to the DB algorithm, the ML-based algorithm performs better in high-AOD conditions over vegetated regions, such as in Southeast Asia, where the DB algorithm significantly underestimates. In low-AOD conditions, the ML-based algorithm performs better over western North America and Australia, where the aerosol composition varies greatly.},

abstract={An increasing number of emerging applications in data science and engineering are based on multidimensional and structurally rich data. The irregularities, however, of high-dimensional data often compromise the effectiveness of standard machine learning algorithms. We hereby propose the Rank- R Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), a tensor-based nonlinear learning model that imposes Canonical/Polyadic decomposition on its parameters, thereby offering two core advantages compared to typical machine learning methods. First, it handles inputs as multilinear arrays, bypassing the need for vectorization, and can thus fully exploit the structural information along every data dimension. Moreover, the number of the model's trainable parameters is substantially reduced, making it very efficient for small sample setting problems. We establish the universal approximation and learnability properties of Rank- R FNN, and we validate its performance on real-world hyperspectral datasets. Experimental evaluations show that Rank- R FNN is a computationally inexpensive alternative of ordinary FNN that achieves state-of-the-art performance on higher-order tensor data.},

pages={2186-2193},
abstract={This paper proposes a rain rate retrieval algorithm for conical-scanning microwave imagers (RAMARS), as an alternative to the NASA Goddard profiling (GPROF) algorithm, that does not rely on any a priori information. The fundamental basis of the RAMARS follows the concept of the GPROF algorithm, which means, being consistent with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar rain rate observations, but independent of any auxiliary information. The RAMARS is built upon the combination of state-of-the-art machine learning and regression techniques, comprising of random forest algorithm, RReliefF, and multivariate adaptive regression splines. The RAMARS is applicable to both over ocean and land as well as coast surface terrains. It has been demonstrated that, when comparing with the TRMM Precipitation Radar observations, the performance of the RAMARS algorithm is comparable with the 2A12 GPROF algorithm. Furthermore, the RAMARS has been applied to two cyclonic cases, hurricane Sandy in 2012, and cyclone Mahasen in 2013, showing a very good capability to reproduce the structure and intensity of the cyclone fields. The RAMARS is highly flexible, because of its four processing components, making it extremely suitable for use to other passive microwave imagers in the global precipitation measurement (GPM) constellation.},

abstract={In this study, wetland trends in Alberta were investigated in the past four decades using Landsat satellite imagery to produce updated information about wetland changes and to prevent further degradation of these valuable natural resources. All the processing steps and analyses were conducted in Google earth engine (GEE) to produce 16 wetland maps from 1984 to 2020. A comprehensive change analysis showed 1) approximately 18% of the province was subjected to change; 2) in terms of wetland classes, there was a decreasing trend for the Shallow Water and Swamp classes and an increasing trend for the Fen and Marsh classes; 3) in terms of nonwetland classes, there was a considerable decreasing trend for the Forest class and increasing trend for the Grassland/Shrubland class; 4) wetland loss was approximately 22 000 km2, which was mainly due to the conversion of wetlands to Forest and Grassland/Shrubland; 5) wetland gain was approximately 24 000 km2, which was mainly due to the conversion from the Forest class to wetlands, especially the Swamp and Fen classes; 6) the highest class transition was from Cropland to Grassland/Shrubland and vice versa (29 000 km2), from Forest to different wetland classes (18 000 km2), and from Fen to Forest (6000 km2). In summary, the results of this study provided the first comprehensive information on wetland trends in Alberta over the past 37 years and will assist policymakers to adjust the required/established policies to mitigate the potential wetland changes due to anthropogenic activities and climate-related events.},

abstract={The threat of hurricanes to the security and resiliency of power systems is increasing with climate change and global warming. Due to the complex relationship between the hurricane disaster and power outages, it is difficult for power system operators to predict outages accurately and allocate emergency supplies in advance. Therefore, establishing an efficient and effective approach to forecast power outage distribution is critical for hurricane mitigation and loss reduction. This paper proposes a machine-learning based prediction methodology based on the realistic historical hurricane outage data. The proposed methodology includes two parts: (1) rectifying gust via the power law, and (2) configuring stacked model based on machine learning algorithms and metrics optimization. In particular, the proposed gust rectification algorithm can improve the interpolation precision effectively. By implementing this configuration, the stacked model has a much better performance than the single model in the stacking processing. This model is trained by a comprehensive data set that consists of the information of hurricanes, power systems, and geography. In the case study, the realistic data of two historical hurricanes is applied to verify the developed model. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can improve the performance of power outage prediction effectively.},

abstract={Penetration of solar energy into main grid has gradually increased in recent years due to a growing number of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) farms. The power output of these PV farms may fluctuate due to a wide variability of meteorological conditions, and, thus, we need to compensate for this effect in advance. In this paper, we propose a solar power prediction model based on various satellite images and a support vector machine (SVM) learning scheme. The motion vectors of clouds are forecasted by utilizing satellite images of atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs). We analyze 4 years' historical satellite images and utilize them to configure a large number of input and output data sets for the SVM learning. We compare the performance of the proposed SVM-based model, the conventional time-series model, and an artificial neural network (ANN) model in terms of prediction accuracy.},

abstract={The ubiquity of devices in Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up a large source for IoT data. Machine learning (ML) models with big IoT data is beneficial to our daily life in monitoring air condition, pollution, climate change, etc. However, centralized conventional ML models rely on all clients’ data at a central server, which seriously threatens user privacy. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution aiming to protect user privacy by enabling model training on a large corpus of decentralized data. The recent studies indicate FL suffers from the heterogeneity issue as it treats all clients’ data equally, that is, FL might sacrifice the performance of the majority of clients to accommodate the performance of the minority of clients with low usability data. In order to overcome this issue, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based intelligent central server with the capability of recognizing heterogeneity is implemented, which can help lead the trend toward better performance for majority of clients. To be specific, an FL central server analyses the benefits of different collaboration by capturing the intricate patterns in heterogeneous clients based on rating feedback and then updates clients’ weights iteratively, until it establishes a coalition of clients with quasioptimal performance. The experimental results on three real data sets under various heterogeneity levels demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed solution.},

abstract={Due to the effect of climate change on the hydrological cycle process, the severity and frequency of drought have increased. Typically, drought begins with meteorological drought, after which it propagates to agricultural and hydrological drought. Thus, it is essential to investigate the process involved in the drought propagation from meteorological to groundwater drought. In this study, we investigated groundwater drought by calculating the standardized groundwater level index (SGI) using predicted groundwater storage changes (GWSC) based on satellite data-driven deep learning models. The GWSC was predicted using two deep learning models (the convolution neural network-long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) and LSTM), and the results were validated using in situ observation data. In addition, the SGI was compared to meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought indices based on remote sensed data, and the drought propagation was analyzed. This study revealed the potential of satellite data-driven deep learning models for assessing groundwater droughts, which is important for the development of multi-scale drought monitoring systems.},

abstract={The capability and synergistic use of multisource satellite observations for flood monitoring and forecasts is crucial for improving disaster preparedness and mitigation. Here, surface fractional water cover (FW) retrievals derived from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L-band (1.4 GHz) brightness temperatures were used for flood assessment over southeast Africa during the Cyclone Idai event. We then focused on five subcatchments of the Pungwe basin and developed a machine learning based approach with the support of Google Earth Engine for daily (24-h) forecasting of FW and 30-m inundation downscaling and mapping. The Classification and Regression Trees model was selected and trained using retrievals derived from SMAP and Landsat coupled with rainfall forecasts from the NOAA Global Forecast System. Independent validation showed that FW predictions over randomly selected dates are highly correlated (R = 0.87) with the Landsat observations. The forecast results captured the flood temporal dynamics from the Idai event; and the associated 30-m downscaling results showed inundation spatial patterns consistent with independent satellite synthetic aperture radar observations. The data-driven approach provides new capacity for flood monitoring and forecasts leveraging synergistic satellite observations and big data analysis, which is particularly valuable for data sparse regions.},

abstract={The latest World Health Organization's (WHO) study on 2018 is showing that about 1.5 million people died and around 10 million people are infected with tuberculosis (TB) each year. Moreover, more than 4,000 people die every day from TB. A number of those deaths could have been stopped if the disease was identified sooner. In the recent literature, important work can be found on automating the diagnosis by applying techniques of deep learning (DL) to the medical images. While DL has yielded promising results in many areas, comprehensive TB diagnostic studies remain limited. DL requires a large number of high-quality training samples to yield better performance. Due to the low contrast of TB chest x-ray (CXR) images, they are often is in poor quality. This work assesses the effect of image enhancement on performance of DL technique to address this problem. The employed image enhancement algorithm was able to highlight the overall or local characteristics of the images, including some interesting features. Specifically, three image enhancement algorithms called Unsharp Masking (UM), High-Frequency Emphasis Filtering (HEF) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), were evaluated. The enhanced image samples were then fed to the pre-trained ResNet and EfficientNet models for transfer learning. In a TB image dataset, we achieved 89.92% and 94.8% of classification accuracy and AUC (Area Under Curve) scores, respectively. All the results are obtained using Shenzhen dataset, which are available in the public domain.},

abstract={The thermocline in the ocean is an important phenomenon in marine scientific research. Its distribution affects not only the delineation of vertical boundaries of water masses, but also the activities of underwater vehicles, the use of underwater acoustic instruments and the development of marine fisheries. Therefore, it is significant to determine the boundary of thermocline accurately. This paper adopts the K-means clustering method in machine learning to analyze the Argo data of the sea area (10.5°~25.5°S, 55.5°~80.5°S), and the distribution stereogram of this sea area data is obtained to determine the highly possible area of thermocline. Then the traditional thermocline determination method is combined with the information entropy method in machine learning to determine the thermocline and its boundary in this area. Finally, the occurrence area and boundary position of thermocline are obtained. In the future, this method can be applied to determine the thermocline in different areas, and then merge the regional thermoclines together to eventually realize the determination of the three-dimensional thermocline in the global sea area.},

Equipping existing deep learning models with an (general) notion of uncertainty can help mitigate both these issues. The Bayesian deep learning community has developed model-agnostic methodology to estimate both data and model uncertainty that can be implemented on top of existing deep learning models. In this work, we test this methodology for deep recurrent satellite time series forecasting and test its assumptions on data and model uncertainty. We tested its effectiveness on an application on climate change where the activity of seasonal vegetation decreased over multiple years.},

title={A Progressive Learning Strategy for Large-Scale Glacier Mapping},
year={2022},
volume={10},

pages={72615-72627},
abstract={In recent years, the worldwide temperature increase has resulted in rapid deglaciation and a higher risk of glacier-related natural hazards such as flooding and debris flow. Due to the severity of these hazards, continuous observation and detailed analysis of glacier fluctuations are crucial. Many such analyses require an accurately delineated glacier boundary. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of glaciers, particularly debris-covered glaciers (DCGs), poses a challenge for glacier mapping when using conventional remote sensing or machine-learning techniques. Some examples exist about small-scale automated glacier mapping, but large or regional-scale mapping is challenging. Previously, a deep-learning-based approach named GlacierNet2 had been developed to accurately delineate the complete DCG outlines on the regional scope via taking advantage of multiple models. This paper uses a modified version of GlacierNet2 to study the feasibility and effectiveness of large-scale glacier mapping in Nepal Himalaya, Karakoram, and parts of western Himalaya. Also, we propose a large-scale mapping strategy to progressively enhance the network familiarity to varied types of glaciers via systematically repeating the training process. This strategy allows the network to delineate a large number of glaciers while only requiring a small proportion of initial training data. Thus, resulting in a significant drop in labor and expert intervention, which are required for selecting and labeling the training data. Our results show a successful and accurate generation of glacier boundaries with an intersection over union (IOU) score of 0.8115 in the Karakoram and parts of western Himalaya and an IOU of 0.7525 in the Nepal Himalaya. Our work outlines how future efforts of large and global scale mapping can be developed to monitor and analyze glacier dynamics.},

pages={9887-9901},
abstract={Sea ice has a significant effect on climate change and ship navigation. Hence, it is crucial to draw sea-ice maps that reflect the geographical distribution of different types of sea ice. Many automatic sea-ice classification methods using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are based on the polarimetric characteristics or image texture features of sea ice. They either require professional knowledge to design the parameters and features or are sensitive to noise and condition changes. Moreover, ice changes over time are often ignored. In this article, we propose a new SAR sea-ice image classification method based on a combined learning of spatial and temporal features, derived from residual convolutional neural networks (ResNet) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. In this way, we achieve automatic and refined classification of sea-ice types. First, we construct a seven-type ice data set according to the Canadian Ice Service ice charts. We extract spatial feature vectors of a time series of sea-ice samples using a trained ResNet network. Then, using the feature vectors as inputs, the LSTM network further learns the variation of the set of sea-ice samples with time. Finally, the extracted high-level features are fed into a softmax classifier to output the most recent ice type. Taking both spatial features and time variation into consideration, our method can achieve a high classification accuracy of 95.7% for seven ice types. Our method can automatically produce more objective sea-ice interpretation maps, allowing detailed sea-ice distribution and improving the efficiency of sea-ice monitoring tasks.},

abstract={High spatial resolution remote sensing (HSRRS) images classification and identification is an important technology to acquire land surface information for land resource management, geographical situation monitoring, and global climate change. As the hottest deep learning method, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully applied in HSRRS image classification and identification due to its powerful information extraction capability. However, adversarial perturbations caused by radiation transfer process or artificial or other unpredictable disturbances often deteriorate the stability of CNN. Under this background, we propose a robust architecture for adversarial attack and detection to classify and identify HSRRS images. First of all, two white-box attacks [i.e., large Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS) and fast gradient sign method (FGSM)] are adopted respectively to generate adversarial images to confuse the model, and to assess the robustness of the HSRRS image classifier. Second, adversarial detection models based on support vector machine (SVM) with single or fused two level features are proposed to improve the detection accuracy. The features extracted from the testing CNN full connected layers contain adversarial perturbations and real information, from which SVM classifier and discriminate the real and the adversarial images. The adversarial attack model is evaluated in terms of overall accuracy ( $OA$ ) and kappa coefficient ( $kc$ ). The simulation results show that the $OA$ decreases from 96.4% to 44.4% and 33.3% for L-BFGS and FGSM attacked classifier model, respectively. The adversarial detection is evaluated via $OA$ , detection probability $P_{D}$ , false alarm probability $P_{FA}$ , and miss probability $P_{M}$ . The simulation results indicate that the fused model with two different level features based on SVM can obtain the best $OA$ (94.5%), $P_{D}$ (0.933), $P_{FA}$ (0.040), and $P_{M}$ (0.067) among the detectors if the classifier is attacked by the FGSM. Meanwhile, when facing the L-BFGS attack, the fused model presents similar performance if the best single level features are utilized.},

Three state-of-the-art methods are tested: Faster-RCNN, RetinaNet, and ATSS. A total of 220 images were used, in which we manually labeled 3382 trees. For the proposal task, our findings show that ATSS is 3% more accurate than Faster-RCNN and 4% than RetinaNet. However, in a qualitative inspection, Faster-RCNN and RetinaNet seems to be better at this task. Our findings shows the need of further research for developing suitable tools for urban tree detection. This tools can help cities top achieve a more sustainable and resilient environment especially to face climate change.},

abstract={With the development of computer technology and expanding environmental issues, machine learning has received more and more attention in the field of weather forecasting. Global Navigation Satellite System-Radio Occultation(GNSS-RO) technology is a kind of remote sensing technology. This investigation proposes an alternative to numerical weather forecasting model. The new method is based on machine learning utilizing GNSS-RO data to forecast the wind field in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China. The dataset including temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction was obtained by numerical calculation in terms of historical monitoring data in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Then the models of wind fields forecasting based on machine learning were established with different neural network including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The prediction performance of different models was analyzed. The results demonstrate that LSTM and CNN have better performance on predicting the wind field than Deep Neural Networks. The wind speed error is about 1.4m/s, and the wind direction error is about 30°. Moreover, the time required for neural network to predict a new sample is about 1 second, which is only 0.2% of the prediction time compared with numerical model. Finally, the machine learning model can be used to predict the wind field effectively, with GNSS-RO data as the input in application. This paper pro-vides a new method in sight to use machine learning to forecast the regional wind field utilizing GNSS-RO data.},

abstract={Road transportation is one of the largest sectors of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions affecting climate change. Tackling climate change as a global community will require new capabilities to measure and inventory road transport emissions. However, the large scale and distributed nature of vehicle emissions make this sector especially challenging for existing inventory methods. In this work, we develop machine learning models that use satellite imagery to perform indirect top-down estimation of road transport emissions. Our initial experiments focus on the United States, where a bottom-up inventory was available for training our models. We achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 39.5 kg CO2 of annual road transport emissions, calculated on a pixel-by-pixel (100 m2) basis in Sentinel-2 imagery. We also discuss key model assumptions and challenges that need to be addressed to develop models capable of generalizing to global geography. We believe this work is the first published approach for automated indirect top-down estimation of road transport sector emissions using visual imagery and represents a critical step towards scalable, global, near-real-time road transportation emissions inventories that are measured both independently and objectively.},

abstract={Detailed knowledge of air temperature (Ta) is desired for various scientific applications. However, in the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the meteorologically observed Ta is limited due to the low density and uneven distribution of stations. This paper aims to develop a 1-km resolution monthly mean Ta dataset over the TP during 2001-2015 from remote sensing and auxiliary data. 11 environmental variables were extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data and topographic index data. Ten machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared to determine the optimal model for Ta estimation in the TP. The Cubist algorithm outperformed other methods, having the highest accuracy and the lowest sensitivity to cloud contamination. To minimize the overfitting problem, a simple forward variable selection method was introduced and six variables were selected from the original11 environmental variables. Among these six variables, nighttime land surface temperature (Ts) was the most important predictor, followed by elevation and solar radiance. The seasonal performance of the Cubist model was also assessed. The model had good accuracies in all four seasons, with the highest accuracy in winter (R2 = 0.98 and MAE = 0.63 °C) and the lowest accuracy in summer (R2 = 0.91 and MAE = 0.86 °C). Due to the gaps in MODIS data caused by cloud cover, there were 0.39% missing values in the estimated Ta. To improve the data integrity, Delaunay triangulation interpolation was applied to fill the missing Ta values. The final monthly (2001-2015) Ta dataset had an overall accuracy of RMSE = 1.00 °C and MAE = 0.73 °C. It provides valuable information for climate change assessment and other environmental studies in the TP.},

abstract={Catastrophes and accidents could look out for us at every moment leading to unhappy and expensive material damage or worse, to inevitable tragedies. Preventing this kind of events is a must that is taking long sessions of research, tries and development. In most cases, the cheapest and most optimized solution, which makes use of resources economically, is the one that many experts are looking for. This paper is a general overview focusing on environmental warnings, such as deforestation implying both the natural and artificial causes that stands at its basis and on analyzing and proposing some systems with both of their advantages and disadvantages. The relation of the given systems examples and the new trend of IoT (Internet of Things) is made up by cloud computing, crowdsourcing and edge computing used for filtering the most time-sensitive data from huge amount of data coming from the end devices. In addition, the paper presents some information related to climate changes and the way they affected the environment, national monitoring of these changes and the emission factor in the forests with possible solution for reducing it.},

abstract={The health of the coral reefs is at risk due to the increase in water pollution and climate change. The destruction of these coral reefs becomes relevant as the Philippines has a huge coral reef presence making it the second largest in Southeast Asia. The early detection of coral bleaching and deterioration may be able to decrease the death rate of corals. This study focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify a coral’s state: (1) Healthy, (2) Dead and (3) Bleached. The model developed in this study will then classify these corals to determine which corals need harvesting or regeneration. There are two datasets used in this study for comparison purposes. To build the dataset for this study, the researchers compiled images from known datasets used in other studies. The images for alive corals were taken from the RSMAS, dead corals from EILAT while bleached corals were taken from ReefBase. The results of the second dataset have an accuracy of 84.93% which is better than the first dataset that have an accuracy of 68.75%. The results showed that datasets which have larger sample size perform better than smaller datasets. It also showed that for machine learning models, the quantity outperforms the quality of image data.},

pages={4490-4503},
abstract={The recent applications of fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have shown to improve the semantic segmentation of very high resolution (VHR) remote-sensing images because of the excellent feature representation and end-to-end pixel labeling capabilities. While many FCN-based methods concatenate features from multilevel encoding stages to refine the coarse labeling results, the semantic gap between features of different levels and the selection of representative features are often overlooked, leading to the generation of redundant information and unexpected classification results. In this article, we propose an attention-guided label refinement network (ALRNet) for improved semantic labeling of VHR images. ALRNet follows the paradigm of the encoder-decoder architecture, which progressively refines the coarse labeling maps of different scales by using the channelwise attention mechanism. A novel attention-guided feature fusion module based on the squeeze-and-excitation module is designed to fuse higher level and lower level features. In this way, the semantic gaps among features of different levels are declined, and the category discrimination of each pixel in the lower level features is strengthened, which is helpful for subsequent label refinement. ALRNet is tested on three public datasets, including two ISRPS 2-D labeling datasets and the Wuhan University aerial building dataset. Results demonstrated that ALRNet had shown promising segmentation performance in comparison with state-of-the-art deep learning networks. The source code of ALRNet is made publicly available for further studies.},

abstract={The frequency and intensity of natural disasters (i.e. wildfires, storms, floods) has increased over recent decades. Extreme weather can often be linked to climate change, and human population expansion and urbanization have led to a growing risk. In particular floods due to large amounts of rainfall are of rising severity and are causing loss of life, destruction of buildings and infrastructure, erosion of arable land, and environmental hazards around the world. Expanding urbanization along rivers and creeks often includes opening flood plains for building construction and river straightening and dredging speeding up the flow of water. In a flood event, rapid response is essential which requires knowledge which buildings are susceptible to flooding and which roads are still accessible. To this aim, SpaceNet 8 is the first remote sensing machine learning training dataset combining building footprint detection, road network extraction, and flood detection covering 850km2, including 32k buildings and 1,300km roads of which 13% and 15% are flooded, respectively.},

abstract={Automatic detection of mesoscale oceanic eddies is in great demand to monitor their dynamics which play a significant role in ocean current circulation and marine climate change. Traditional methods of eddies detection using remotely sensed data are usually based on physical parameters, geometrics, handcrafted features or expert knowledge, they face a great challenge in accuracy and efficiency due to the high variability of oceanic eddies and our limited understanding of their physical process, especially for rich and large remotely sensed data. In this paper, we propose a simple deep architecture DeepEddy to detect oceanic eddies automatically and be free of expert knowledge. DeepEddy can learn high-level and invariant features of oceanic eddies hierarchically. It is designed with two principal component analysis (PCA) convolutional layers for eddies feature learning, a binary hashing layer for non-linear transformation, a feature pooling layer using block-wise histograms and spatial pyramid pooling to resolve the complicated structures and poses of oceanic eddies, and a classifier for the final eddies identification. We verify the accuracy of the architecture with comprehensive experiments on high spatial resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. We achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.68%.},

pages={2137-2141},
abstract={The understanding of different characteristics of the stratiform and convective system is important for meteorological research, including precipitation retrievals from satellite observations, precipitation parameterization in numerical prediction models, and precipitation climatology. In this study, the possibility of discriminating rain types using deep learning techniques is examined using satellite microwave observation data. Herein, we build two types of deep neural networks for rain type classification, i.e., U-net (RTC-U-net) and fully connected neural network (RTC-fcNN). Experiments are performed with the data obtained from two sensors onboard the global precipitation measurement (GPM) satellite. The brightness temperatures observed from the GPM microwave imager (GMI) are used as input features, whereas rain types retrieved by dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) are used as labels. We generated the merged 40- $\times $ -40 pixel data for training and testing the data set by cropping the GMI observed fields overlapping the DPR observations. Overall, the proposed RTC-U-net and RTC-fcNN effectively classify four rain types, i.e., no-rain, stratiform, convective, and others. The total accuracy for the four rain types is 0.95, and the weighted mean of precision, recall, and f-score for stratiform and convective are 0.76, 0.68, and 0.71, respectively. Results show that the proposed techniques can extract the characteristics of each rain type from the data itself. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply a segmentation method with U-net for rain type classification.},

abstract={Projection of changes in extreme indices of climate variables such as temperature and precipitation are critical to assess the potential impacts of climate change on human-made and natural systems, including critical infrastructures and ecosystems. While impact assessment and adaptation planning rely on high-resolution projections (typically in the order of a few kilometers), state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) are available at spatial resolutions of few hundreds of kilometers. Current solutions to obtain high-resolution projections of ESMs include downscaling approaches that consider the information at a coarse-scale to make predictions at local scales. Complex and non-linear interdependence among local climate variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and large-scale predictors (e.g., pressure fields) motivate the use of neural network-based super-resolution architectures. In this work, we present auxiliary variables informed spatio-temporal neural architecture for statistical downscaling. The current study performs daily downscaling of precipitation variable from an ESM output at 1.15 degrees (115 km) to 1/4 degrees (25 km) over one of the most climatically diversified countries, India. We showcase significant improvement gain against two popular state-of-the-art baselines with a better ability to predict statistics of extreme events. To facilitate reproducible research, we make available all the codes, processed datasets, and trained models in the public domain.},

pages={2587-2597},
abstract={Global forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is very important in quantifying carbon stock, and, therefore, it is necessary to estimate forest AGB accurately. Many studies have obtained reliable AGB estimates by using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. However, it is difficult to obtain LiDAR data continuously at regional or global scale. Although many studies have integrated multisource data to estimate biomass to compensate for these deficiencies, few methods can be applied to produce global time series of high-resolution AGB due to the complexity of the method, data source limitations, and large uncertainty. This study developed a new method to produce a global forest AGB map using multiple data sources-including LiDAR-derived biomass products, a suite of high-level satellite products, forest inventory data, and other auxiliary datasets-to train estimated models for five different forest types. We explored three machine learning methods [artificial neural network, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT)] to build the estimated models. The GBRT method was the optimal algorithm for generating a global forest AGB map at a spatial resolution of 1 km. The independent validation result showed good accuracy with an R2 value of 0.90 and a root mean square error value of 35.87 Mg/ha. Moreover, we compared the generated global forest AGB map with several other forest AGB maps and found the results to be highly consistent. An important feature of this new method is its ability to produce time series of high-resolution global forest AGB maps because it heavily relies on high-level satellite products.},

pages={414-424},
abstract={Primary information of great importance to various grand challenges such as sustainable agricultural intensification, food insecurity, and climate change impacts, can be obtained indirectly from land cover monitoring. However, in arid-to-semiarid regions, such as Iraq, accurate discrimination of different vegetation types is challenging due to their similar spectral responses. Moreover, Iraq has been subjected to major disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic which have affected the distribution of land cover types through space and time. Reliable information about croplands and natural vegetation in such regions is generally scarce. This research aimed to develop a phenology-based classification approach using support vector machines for the assessment of space-time distribution of the dominant vegetation land cover (VLC) types in Iraq, particularly croplands, from 2002 to 2012. Thirteen successive years of 8-day composites of MODIS-NDVI data at a spatial resolution of 250 m were employed to estimate 11 phenological parameters. The classification methodology was assessed using reference samples taken from fine spatial resolution imagery and independent testing data obtained through fieldwork. Overall accuracies were generally ${>} {85}\,\% $, with relatively high Kappa coefficients $\left({ {>} {0}.{86}} \right)$ across the classified land cover types. The predicted cropland class area and the Global MODIS land cover product were compared with ground statistical data at the governorate level, revealing a significantly larger coefficient of determination for the present phenology-based approach $\left({{{{R}}^{{2}}} = 0.70\;\text{against} \;{{\text {R}}^{{2}}} = 0.33\;\text{for\;MODIS},\;{\text{p} < 0.05}} \right)$. The resulting maps delimit for the first time, at a fine spatial resolution, the spatial and interannual variability in the dominant VLC classes across Iraq.},

abstract={Earthquake prediction is a challenging job and researchers are struggling to predict earthquakes since long time. The involvement of huge multidimensional data, data privacy considerations and transmission latency make it difficult to predict earthquakes in real time.

It is unique among early earthquake warning systems as federated learning technique (FL) has been applied for incorporating the intelligence from cloud to the mobile edge devices. Features like onsite data collection, training of local data models and aggregation of these models for the generation of global data model makes FL capable enough to handle data privacy, data availability and resolve latency issues involved in earthquake prediction. The proposed system integrates multiple data sources using FL for generation of global data model, applies time series regression for earthquake prediction and transmits earthquake alerts to all connected users and agencies. Dataset from Western Himalayan zone has been collected from 1985 to 2020 considering five different aspects including seismicity, atmospheric temperature, atmospheric pressure, regional rainfall, and reservoir parameters using federated learning technique for experimentation.

pages={126180-126187},
abstract={The tropical area has a large area of peatland, which is an important ecosystem that is regarded as home by millions of people, plants and animals. However, the dried-up and degraded peatland becomes extremely easy to burn, and in case of fire, it will further release transboundary haze. In order to protect the peatland, an improved tropical peatland fire weather index (FWI) system is proposed by combining the ground water level (GWL) with the drought code (DC). In this paper, LoRa based IoT system for peatland management and detection was deployed in Raja Musa Forest Reserve (RMFR) in Kuala Selangor, Malaysia. Then, feasibility of data collection by the IoT system was verified by comparing the correlation between the data obtained by the IoT system and the data from Malaysian Meteorological Department (METMalaysia). An improved model was proposed to apply the ground water level (GWL) for Fire Weather Index (FWI) formulation in Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS). Specifically, Drought Code (DC) is formulated using GWL, instead of temperature and rain in the existing model. From the GWL aggregated from the IoT system, the parameter is predicted using machine learning based on a neural network. The results show that the data monitored by the IoT system has a high correlation of 0.8 with the data released by METMalaysia, and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and real values of the ground water level of the two sensor nodes deployed through neural network machine learning are 0.43 and 12.7 respectively. This finding reveals the importance and feasibility of the ground water level used in the prediction of the tropical peatland fire weather index system, which can be used to the maximum extent to help predict and reduce the fire risk of tropical peatland.},

abstract={As an essential resource in High Mountain Regions (HMR), evaluating the glacial lake dynamics is of great significance to explore the impacts of climate changes and predict the risks of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). However, complicated and laborious methods for glacial lake mapping are unpractically applied in automatically monitoring glacial lakes at a large-scale region. In this work, we explored the mapping efficiency of glacial lakes by combing Generative Adversarial Networks and multi-level feature pyramid (GANMFP) in HMR. We first sampled the image patches containing glacial lakes from Landsat-8 raw data to evaluate the model performance. Totally, 6583 patches with 256x256x7 pixels are randomly cropped from 62 Landsat-8 images. Then we employed these data to train and test the GAN model, which integrated a multi-level feature fusion module in generator and a Resnet-152 networks in discriminator. From the validation results and result visualization, our method achieved good performances in Precision (88.42), Recall (59.61), and Overall Accuracy (99.28), which shows excellent potential in glacial lake mapping at a large-scale region.},

In the second level, the dominating mangrove species were successfully classified within the living mangrove cover (kappa index of 75.21 %). Secondly mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB) was estimated on a national scale, based on fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel- 2 data and national mangrove forest inventory data by using a Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning technique, resulting in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 32.181 Mg.ha−1 and a R2 of 0.542.},

abstract={Safety process of any person is major importance in the industries application, particularly in coal mine areas, where numerous accidents occur with minor mistakes and many persons were injured or died or stuck for long time. In this research, we investigate the economical, efficient and sustainable system for the coal miners for improving protection levels. This system synchronizes the multiple sensors that respond various operations. It is also detecting the various parameters for the protection of coal miners including checking whether the miner is alive or not, depth of the minor, pressure upon the minor, the temperature, humidity inside the mines, hazard gasses level, burning fire inside the mine and Geophysical location of the miners inside the mines. An emergency button is also placed to send alert if any uncertain accident occurs inside mines. All these sensed parameters will then send to the control room where it operates and monitor the safety precaution. In case of any disaster maximum lives may retain by setting priority to dig those places first where the miners are alive. The complete system is implemented on a signal wearing jacket and the signal will be transmitted wirelessly usingESPS2 WI- FI module to the IP of router. Arduino will receive the data from sensors which is linked with WI- FI module via serial communication. ESP32 will then transmit the data to respective node and furthermore that node will send the data to the Control Room for monitoring and taking any action if required.},

abstract={Our work is motivated by an important network design problem in climate adaptation. As floods become more frequent and severe due to climate change, it is increasingly crucial that road infrastructure be strategically upgraded to support post-disaster recovery efforts and normal functionality. We focus on the problem of allocating a fixed budget towards restoring edges to maximize the satisfied travel demand between locations in a network, which we formalize as the budget-constrained prize-collecting Steiner forest problem. We prove that the satisfiable travel demand objective exhibits restricted supermodularity over forests, and utilize this property to design an iterative algorithm based on maximizing successive modular lower bounds for the objective that finds better solutions than a baseline greedy approach. We also propose an extremely fast heuristic for maximizing modular functions subject to knapsack and graph matroid constraints that can be used as a subroutine in the iterative algorithm, or as a standalone method that matches the greedy baseline in terms of quality but is orders of magnitude faster. We evaluate the algorithms on synthetic data, and apply them to a real-world instance of retrofitting the Senegal national road network against flooding.},

abstract={Spatio-temporal data sets such as satellite image series are of utmost importance for understanding global developments like climate change or urbanization. However, incompleteness of data can greatly impact usability and knowledge discovery. In fact, there are many cases where not a single data point in the set is fully observed. For filling gaps, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes Markov random fields (MRFs). We extend the probabilistic framework to also consider empirical prior information, which allows to train even on highly incomplete data. Moreover, we devise a way to make discrete MRFs predict continuous values via state superposition. Experiments on real-world remote sensing imagery suffering from cloud cover show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art gap filling techniques.},

abstract={Ecosystem model prediction is important for understanding ecosystem responses to climate change and for management support. Model prediction and quantification of predictive uncertainty of ecosystems have long been investigated. The traditional workflow, which calibrates models to match observations and then uses the calibrated models for predictions, relies heavily on inverse modeling to constrain uncertain parameters in complex forward models. This inversion-based prediction approach is infeasible for complex models with heterogeneous parameter uncertainties and incapable of rapid integration of streaming and multiple sources of data because of the difficulty and computational cost in the model inversion, which is typically ill-posed and can require hundreds of thousands of expensive forward simulations to be performed iteratively. We propose to circumvent inverse modeling by precomputing an ensemble of unconstrained forward simulations and then using machine learning (ML) methods to learn the statistical relationship between simulated observation and prediction quantities. Once the ML model has learned the relationship, it can be used to make predictions of future system behavior with uncertainty quantification based on observations. The proposed learningbased inversion-free model prediction (LIMP) framework is computationally efficient which only requires a few thousands of fully parallelizable forward simulations. Additionally, LIMP can continually update predictions based on streaming observations from multiple locations and sources without necessarily requiring extra model simulations. In this study, we apply LIMP to a regional terrestrial ecosystem model with 47 parameters for testing, refining, and evaluating the approach. We demonstrate that LIMP can be used for efficient model prediction, rapid data assimilation, and cost-effective experimental design for improving robust predictive understanding of ecosystems.},

abstract={Though flooding is seen as a common environmental threat globally, it has dramatically increased recently due to climate change, impacting underdeveloped and developing countries dangerously. For example, in most developing countries like Ghana, flooding has affected over four million people in terms of property damage, loss of lives, income and spread of diseases, resulting in economic harm beyond USD780 million. At least one major flood disaster does occur yearly. The recurring incidences of flooding and associated calamitous socio-economic risks and anticipated increase of its prevalence soon in cities of developing countries such as Ghana have necessitated an intelligence system to offer efficient and early warning of its occurrence. In this study, we explore the potential of the machine learning (ML) computing paradigm to propose a flooding prediction model. Specifically, four state-of-the-art ML algorithms, namely long short-term memory (LSTM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF) and extremely randomised trees (Extra Trees), are used to implement four different flood prediction models. We measure the performance of our developed models with multiple statistical performance evaluators. The experimental results show the potential of the developed models for efficient and effective prediction of flooding. The merit of this study lies in the fact that it is the first to the best of our knowledge to use a combination of environmental factors from Ghana and machine learning algorithms to develop intelligent flood models to help stakeholders make informed decisions.},

abstract={Wind speed prediction is needed in various sectors, such as in industry. However, the weather conditions change all the time, so it is not easy to predict. The wind that blows is influenced by several climatic weather factors such as humidity and rainfall. Also, wind speed patterns change when there is a global climate change, El Nino. Therefore this research involved the element in predicting wind patterns one week ahead. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) methods are used for sequential data processing, such as climate data. Climate data for ten years used were wind speed, humidity, and rainfall provided by Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) of a weather observation station, while Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABM). Data need to be pre-processed to solve missing data. Moreover, all variables were normalized and segmentation by overlapping to avoid data discontinuity. The results showed that the use of the amount of data, learning rate, epoch, and selection of the right optimization model could give good accuracy. The purpose of the proper configuration has a good performance, with accuracy reaching 88.34%. The results showed that the use of SOI factors improved correctness from 74.75% without SOI. The results also show that the model Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) provides better accuracy than the model Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which gives an accuracy of only 71.84%. Meanwhile, the study also examined the effect of the learning rate and composition of training data and test data. The best accuracy is shown for the learning rate of 0.020 and 80:20% of training and test data comparison.},

abstract={Agriculture is the backbone of a country’s economic system, considering that it not only provides food and raw materials but also employment opportunities for a large percentage of the population. In this way, determining the degree of agricultural vulnerability represents a guide for sustainability and adaptability focused on changing future conditions. In many cases, vulnerability analysis data is restricted to use by authorized personnel only, leaving open data policies aside. Furthermore, data in its native format (raw data) by nature tend to be diverse in structure, storage formats, and access protocols. In addition, having a large amount of open data is important (though not sufficient) to obtain accurate results in data-driven analysis. These data require a strict preparation process and having guides that facilitate this process is becoming increasingly necessary. In this study, we present the step by step processing of several open data sources in order to obtain quality information for feedback on different agricultural vulnerability analysis. The data preparation process is applied to a case study corresponding to the upper Cauca river basin in Colombia. All data sources in this study are public, official and are available from different web platforms where they were collected. In the same way, a ranking with the importance of variables for each dataset was obtained through automatic methods and validated through expert knowledge. Experimental validation showed an acceptable agreement between the ranking of automatic methods and the ranking of raters. The result of this study corresponds to 16 processed data sources ready to feed data-driven systems, as well as agricultural vulnerability methodologies.},

abstract={This study aims to improve the accuracy of the coral bleaching monitoring method through the development and implementation of mobile application that can classify bleached corals images from non-bleached images using convolutional neural network.

The system operates using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in classifying the bleaching severity of the corals. It is currently running on Android phones from 4.0 release up to 11. Researchers found that at least 3000 images are needed to train the CNN of the proposed coral bleaching application to achieve at least 90% accuracy, and 0.92 MP, -1 EV and 1600 ISO produces 93% accuracy. Salinity and turbidity of seawater was tested and presented that 1.000-060 g/cm3 of salinity and turbidity using 500-1000 grams of sand does not have substantial effect on the proposed system’s accuracy. The GPS used in the proposed system is 95% accurate. Finally, the researchers recommend for the continuous improvement of the dataset to produce better results in the future.},

abstract={Regions around the world experience adverse climate-change-induced conditions that pose severe risks to the normal and sustainable operations of modern societies. Extreme weather events, such as floods, rising sea levels, and storms, stand as characteristic examples that impair the core services of the global ecosystem. Especially floods have a severe impact on human activities, hence, early and accurate delineation of the disaster is of top priority since it provides environmental, economic, and societal benefits and eases relief efforts. In this article, we introduce OmbriaNet, a deep neural network architecture, based on convolutional neural networks, that detects changes between permanent and flooded water areas by exploiting the temporal differences among flood events extracted by different sensors. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach, we generated OMBRIA, a bitemporal and multimodal satellite imagery dataset for image segmentation through supervised binary classification. It consists of a total number of 3.376 images, synthetic aperture radar imagery from Sentinel-1, and multispectral imagery from Sentinel-2, accompanied with ground-truth binary images produced from data derived by experts and provided from the Emergency Management Service of the European Space Agency Copernicus Program. The dataset covers 23 flood events around the globe, from 2017 to 2021. We collected, co-registrated and preprocessed the data in Google Earth Engine. To validate the performance of our method, we performed different benchmarking experiments on the OMBRIA dataset and we compared with several competitive state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental analysis demonstrated that the proposed formulation is able to produce high-quality flood maps, achieving a superior performance over the state-of-the-art. We provide OMBRIA dataset, as well as OmbriaNet code at: https://github.com/geodrak/OMBRIA.},

abstract={Climate Change in the world gives many impacts on changing rainfall patterns. As a result, potato farming areas such as Tengger, East Java are having problems to determining potato growing times. Because of that, the production of potatoes decreased. It needs a method that can predict rainfall based on rainfall patterns that occur after climate change. Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) is one method that can learn from the data of the past and make it a guide to predict future data. In this research, BPNN is used to predict rainfall in Tengger, East Java using rainfall data from 2005 to 2014 which is the period of climate change. Data from 2005–2009 is used as training data and data from 2010–2014 use as testing data. In addition, this research is also looking for the most optimum parameter modeling of BPNN includes the value of learning rate, hidden layer, and maximum epoch. Based on the test results, the most optimum parameter of BPNN that is using learning rate 0.4, hidden layer 3, and maximum epoch 4000. From the optimum model of BPNN, the result of average error RMSE for 4 location in Tengger is 8.14 from training process and 8.28 from the testing process. The result of RMSE error with BPNN is smaller compared to previous research using Tsukamoto Fuzzy Inference System (FIS).},

pages={196-201},
abstract={In this paper we develop a deep learning model to distinguish dust from cloud and surface using satellite remote sensing image data. The occurrence of dust storms is increasing along with global climate change, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions. Originated from the soil, dust acts as a type of aerosol that causes significant impacts on the environment and human health. The dust and cloud data labels used in this paper are from CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) satellite. The radiometric channels and geometric parameters from VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) satellite sensor serve as features for our model. We trained and tested our deep learning model using 10,000 samples in March 2012. The developed model has five hidden layers and 512 neurons in each layer. The classification accuracy on the test set is 71.1%. In addition, we performed a shuffling procedure to identify the importance of features, which is calculated as the increase in the prediction error after we permute the feature's values. We also developed a method based on genetic algorithm to find the best subset of features for dust detection. The results show that the genetic algorithm can select a subset of features that have comparable performance as that of a model with all features. The shuffling procedure and the genetic algorithm both identify geometric information as important features for detecting mineral dust. The chosen subset will improve computational efficiency for dust detection and improve physical based methods.},

pages={4824-4834},
abstract={The systematic monitoring of glaciers is essential to both evaluate water resource availability and better understand the effects of climate change. The increased speed of glacier changes observed in the past few years requires a more frequent update of the glacier inventories than in the past; however, the high human supervision required by the state-of-the-art techniques is discouraging their systematic application over large areas. This article proposes a novel approach to exploit the large volume of data provided by Copernicus Sentinel missions for detecting glacier outlines, including debris-covered glaciers. In detail, our method exploits the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 multitemporal images to build a composite image representing the glacier conditions during the yearly maximum ablation period. The Sentinel-2 multispectral images are classified with a support vector machine and composed to a mosaic that represents the information of the maximum glacier ablation. At the same time, the Sentinel-1 time series are exploited to build a multitemporal coherence composite that represents all the snow-covered and glaciated areas together with all the moving surfaces. This information is used together with the Sentinal-2 composite to detect the debris-covered part of the glaciers. The proposed method was tested in the Central East Alps and presented an overall accuracy of 92% with respect to a reference inventory over South Tyrol and an agreement of 90% with respect to the latest glacier inventory of the Alps from Sentinel-2. The proposed approach enables to assist glacier experts in identifying glacier outlines over large areas and in short time},

abstract={Sea ice detection is one of the most important applications in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image processing and it always be served for ship navigation and climate change studies. Due to the noise, low resolution and multiple characteristics of SAR images, and limitations of traditional SAR image classification methods, the detection accuracy of traditional sea ice SAR images is not high and can't meet the high precision requirements of application in practice. Deep learning, one of the most popular machine learning methods, have been researched and applied in SAR image classification by some researchers. But, so far, very few researchers have applied deep learning methods to sea ice SAR image detection. In this paper, two scenes of Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR data of sea ice were applied to sea ice detection research using convolutional neural network (CNN). First, the train data is obtained from Gaofen-3 sea ice SAR Image by chipping different classes of SAR images into patches; Then, the different classes train data is used to train the CNN and get the trained CNN model; After the training, the trained CNN model was used to classify the Gaofen-3 sea ice SAR image with sea ice and non-sea ice by a patch-based window traversing the entire SAR image. In order to illustrate the sea ice detection result of deep learning, several traditional SAR image detection methods are experimented for contrast. Experimental results demonstrate that deep learning method is suitable for sea ice SAR image detection and achieves high detection accuracy than others traditional methods.},

abstract={Global warming and climate change are inevitable global issues. It is predicted they will cause global sea level rise (SLR) in incoming years, which may impacting the development of coastal zones, especially in the low lying areas: coastal areas are home to more than one billion people across the globe. The first visible signal of natural hazards is the erosion of the shoreline: erosion is a natural phenomenon due to a fluid substance that flows on a solid one and makes its crumbling; the combination of unstoppable events - upraising sea level - together with critical human activities can speedup this phenomenon.In the last years new software-based approaches in the erosion monitoring have been proposed, mainly based on satellite images, while a few number of them is based on RGB cameras. But a solution that is at the same time cheap, easy to be installed and used, and that does not require human intervention at runtime is not yet been proposed.In this work we propose a system for coastal erosion monitoring based on RGB cameras. This system is very cheap and easy to be installed and maintained, and allows to continuously check the monitored area. The system has been installed and tested in a Marine Protected Area in the Salento region, in the South of Italy. Preliminary results are encouraging and highlight the feasibility of a monitoring system that can be installed everywhere, at reasonable costs.},

abstract={Convective initiation (CI) nowcasting over China has a problem of a high false-alarm rate (FAR) due to the local convective processes, most of which do not produce severe weather. In order to focus on those CIs with severe weather, a new 0-2 h CI nowcasting system is developed in this article, named rapidly developed convection monitoring system (RDCMS), using the data from the advanced geosynchronous radiation imager onboard China Fengyun-4A(FY-4A) satellite. The RDCMS is not only used to identify CIs at the early stage, but also to prevent the relative high FAR. The key solutions of RDCMS are to introduce the total variation L1 norm (TV-L1) optical flow method for more tracking efficiency, and to use a supervised learning method named BP_Adaboost neural network for severe convection checking. Case studies show that the RDCMS' skills have been improved as expected in four regions of China, which are Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the East China, Northeast China, and South China. In the southern China region, the CI lead time is 17-40 min, and the best probability of detection is as high as 0.80, with the FAR lower than 0.34.},

abstract={Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the reliability of each source is taken into consideration. This is done by exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used during the training process to weigh each label according to the related source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.},

abstract={Metocean data plays a crucial role in planning and constructing offshore projects. the success of many offshore projects depends on the accuracy of metocean data analyzing and forecasting. And analyzing metocean data requires a tremendous effort to validate the data and determine the transformation of the metocean data conditions. Hence the wind plays an important role in the climate changes, recurrent neural network approaches such as vanilla recurrent neural network (VRNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and Gated recurrent units (GRU) are used and compared to yield an accurate wind speed forecasting. The highest wind speed forecasting accuracy contribute to the minimization of cost and helps avoiding the operational faulty risk. Different models for estimating the hourly wind speed one hour ahead and one day ahead has been developed according to literature. However, this research compares the mentioned Artificial Neural Networks and selects the outstanding performance model to process the metocean data. The training and validation data of this work has been collected from free oceanic websites.},

Image fusion techniques are applied to fuse the spectral images into a higher-level image of the land cover distribution. In this paper we propose a fuzzy-fusion inference approach for satellite image classification based on a fuzzy process, which uses both a hybrid method to train the classifier and reinforcement aggregation operators in the inference scheme. The approach was tested with land cover maps for the district of Mandimba of the Niassa province, Mozambique and was validated against an expert classification and then with Decision trees and Artificial Neural Networks.},

pages={151938-151951},
abstract={Influenced by climate change and urbanization, urban flood frequently occurs and represents a serious challenge for many cities. Therefore, it is necessary to generate refined predictions of urban floods, such as the prediction of water accumulation processes at water accumulation points, which is of great significance for supporting water-related managers to reduce flood losses. In this study, 16 combination schemes of rainfall sensitivity indicators were used to determine the optimal scheme for predicting the depth of accumulated water, and the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm in deep learning was used to build a prediction model of the accumulation process of urban stormy accumulation points. Among the 16 schemes, the relative error of scheme 1 is 15.39%, and the qualified rate is 92.86%. This scheme exhibits the highest accuracy for the prediction results of water accumulation depth. Given this finding, the GBDT algorithm was used to construct a regression prediction model of the water accumulation process based on the collected historical rainfall water accumulation data of 50 water accumulation points. The results demonstrated that the GBDT regression prediction model has a mean relative error of 19.77%, a qualified rate of 82.00%, and a peak average relative error of 5.48%, which verify the validity and applicability of the model for the real-time prediction of the process of water accumulation.},

pages={182431-182440},
abstract={Changes in the dissolved oxygen concentration of the ocean have important implications for marine ecosystems and global climate change. However, limited by measurement techniques, the hydrology data is not always complete. Thus, accurate prediction on marine dissolved oxygen concentration (MDOC), is a powerful supplement to the current observation data. Deep neural network is a powerful model to do the prediction, while it is usually difficult and time-consuming to tune its structure. Meanwhile, deep jointly informed neural network (DJINN) provides a user friendly method to tune the structure of neural networks. In this article, a deep learning-based model called marine deep jointly informed neural network (M-DJINN), is proposed to predict MDOC. M-DJINN improves DJINN performance via initializing the weights of neural network using a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a variance related to the number of neurons in the neighbor layer. In M-DJINN, to get an ideal deep neural network structure, users only need to tune the tree number and max tree depth. While predicting MDOC on World Ocean Database 2013(WOD13) data with M-DJINN, the novel model proves better than DJINN on both accuracy and convergency. When the max tree depth is set to 10, the mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by 17.6% compared with DJINN. It can be concluded from the experiments that with enough training data, the performance of M-DJINN may keep improving by deepening the neural networks.},

abstract={Indonesia is a country that can experience potentially adverse climate change. More than 50% of the population in Bandung Regency works in the agricultural sector. Hence, the prediction of rainfall is essential in agriculture to produce the best harvest and to minimize losses. In this study, a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm were used to forecast the rainfall in Bandung Regency. Furthermore, an Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) algorithm was added to optimize the model produced due to a class imbalance in the data. The weather data was collected from the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency of Indonesia (BMKG) from 2005–2017. The results showed that using the CART algorithm yielded 93.94% rainfall prediction accuracy with a 1.38 s running time whereas using ADASYN and CART yielded an accuracy of 98.18% with a 1.48 s running time.},

year={2021},
volume={14},
number={},
pages={3495-3503},
abstract={The Southern Ocean comprises 25% of the global ocean surface area, accounts for nearly half of the total carbon sink of the global oceans, and is a place that significantly reduces the impacts of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Due to the sparsity of observational data, the changes in Southern Ocean carbon sinks over time remain uncertain. In this study, we integrated correlation analysis and a feedforward neural network to improve the accuracy of carbon flux estimations in the Southern Ocean. Based on observation data from 1998–2018, we reconstructed the Southern Ocean's pCO2 grid data during this period. The root-mean-square error obtained by fitting the observation data was 8.86 μatm, indicating that the results were better than those of the two primary statistically based models in the Surface Ocean pCO2 mapping intercomparison. The results also showed that the Southern Ocean's capacity to act as a carbon sink has gradually increased since 2000; it reduced during 2010–2013 but increased significantly after that. The Southern Ocean's seasonality is characterized by minimum carbon uptake in winter due to increased upwelling; this is followed by a rapid increase toward maximum uptake in summer, which is mainly biologically driven. There is an apparent double-ring structure in the Southern Ocean, as noted in other studies. This study confirms that the inner ring (50–70°S) is a carbon source area gradually transforming into a carbon sink, while the outer ring (35–50°S) continues to serve as a carbon sink.},

abstract={Weather prediction and meteorological analysis contribute significantly towards sustainable development to reduce the damage from extreme events which could otherwise set-back the progress in development by years. The change in surface temperature is one of the important indicators in detecting climate change. In this research, we propose a novel deep learning model named Spatial Feature Attention Long Short-Term Memory (SFA-LSTM) model to capture accurate spatial and temporal relations of multiple meteorological features to forecast temperature. Significant spatial feature and temporal interpretations of historical data aligned directly to output feature helps the model to forecast data accurately. The spatial feature attention captures mutual influence of input features on the target feature. The model is built using encoder-decoder architecture, where the temporal dependencies in data are learnt using LSTM layers in the encoder phase and spatial feature relations in the decoder phase. SFA-LSTM forecasts temperature by simultaneously learning most important time steps and weather variables. When compared with baseline models, SFA-LSTM maintains the state-of the-art prediction accuracy while offering the benefit of appropriate spatial feature interpretability. The learned spatial feature attention weights are validated from magnitude of correlation with target feature obtained from the dataset.},

pages={157571-157583},
abstract={Continuous monitoring and accurate spatiotemporal groundwater storage change predictions can help support sustainable development and efficient groundwater resources management. In this study, remote sensing-based data were used to develop two deep learning predictive models, long short term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural network-LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models. The input variables were terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) recorded by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites and the GRACE-Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission, precipitation measured by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, average temperature and soil moisture obtained from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) acquired from the Landsat 5 and 8 satellites. A comparison of groundwater storage change predictions by the two deep learning predictive models with in situ measurements of the National Groundwater Monitoring Network (NGMN) in South Korea showed that the CNN-LSTM model was more accurate [root mean square error (RMSE) = 44.92 mm/month, correlation coefficient ( $r) =0.70$ , index of agreement (IOA) = 0.81] than the LSTM model [RMSE = 47.44 mm/month, $r =0.62$ , and IOA = 0.77]. Furthermore, a comparison of the performance of the two models for three specific regions showed that the CNN-LSTM model captured spatiotemporal variations in groundwater storage better. Additionally, a comparison of cumulative change trends in groundwater storage with the NDVI, MNDWI, and TWSA data showed that changes in land cover and total water storage affect groundwater storage. These comparison results demonstrate that the use of parameters recorded by multiple satellites as training data for deep learning models can play an important role in the model’s performance.},

abstract={Sea ice remote sensing is of great significance to the understanding of polar climate change. At present, the global navigation satellite system reflector (GNSS-R) technology has been applied to the study of sea ice remote sensing and achieved good results. In this paper, a convolution neural network (CNN) based method for sea ice recognition (SIR) and estimation of sea ice concentration (SIC) using GNSS-R data is proposed. Specifically, a CNN model is designed to solve the classification problem of SIR and the regression problem of SIC estimation. In the stage of data set construction, first, the global GNSS-R data (TDS-l), in a certain period of time, is spatiotemporally matched with the relatively reliable sea ice data (NSIDC), and then the matched GNSS-R data is extracted to balance the amount of seawater data and sea ice data. In the stage of CNN model construction, the feature learning ability of the model is enhanced by adding convolution layer, pooling layer and full connection layer. Simulation results show that the proposed CNN -based scheme has a higher prediction accuracy of SIR and lower estimation error of SIC than other existing methods.},

Diverse studies have been proposed for weather forecasting but there are very few studies on weather forecasting of Bangladesh. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop a weather forecasting system for Bangladesh’s weather. In this paper, we propose an ensemble model that comprises two popular deep learning-based methods: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) along with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to forecast the temperature of Bangladesh.

abstract={Monitoring rice growth stages is important for maintaining food security, especially from flood and drought, which is more frequent due to climate change. The Sentine1-2 Rice Growth Stages (S-2 RGS) monitoring project from the Ministry of Agriculture is one of the ongoing monitoring systems (http://katam.litbang.pertanian.go.id/sc). However, S-2 RGS has difficulty providing a cloud-free project, especially in the wet season. Sentinel-1 (S-1) has recently been used to identify mapping rice area due to better spatial resolution than the MODIS dataset. This study focuses on mapping the vegetative stage using a multi-look of S-1 dataset with a deep learning method. Deep learning has been proven to be one of the classification methods on non-parametric approaches that give high accuracy, high computation speed, and less memory usage. The method of this study is as follows: First, the S-1 images downloaded from Google Earth Engine, which has been preprocessed accordingly. Secondly, the rice growth stages condition of Indramayu Regency was extracted from S-2 RGS using random sampling on 16 May 2020. Next step, both multi-look S-1 (Ascending, Descending). Third, the values of RGS was reclassified from four classes (Bare land, Vegetative, Reproductive, and Ripening) into two class (vegetative and Non-vegetative). Finally, the vegetative stage was modeled from four predictors (DESC-VH, DESC-VV, ASC-VH, ASC-VV) using deep learning using two layers with a training dataset (n=9,319). The accuracy of the model is 73.6% (n=3,994).

abstract={Detection and Prediction of extreme weather events have always been important and challenging task, which has become very significant while the whole world is experiencing adverse effect of climate change. The cyclone, one of the extreme weather events has become very often and intense in Indian sub-continent areas in last few decades and its accurate detection and prediction has become very relevant. In this direction, machine learning (ML) based approached has become very popular than other conventional methods. However, the performance of the traditional ML based approaches is highly dependent on hand crafted feature engineering. In contrast, deep learning, an advance ML eliminates such barrier and selects the feature set automatically in hierarchical way, which has already displayed significant performance in various domain of research including weather forecasting. In this purpose, convolutional long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) can efficiently extract spatial and temporal information, which are very important for accurate detection of extreme weather events. Therefore, a model with ConvLSTM has been proposed in this work to detect and predict the cyclone in India. For validation, Community Atmospheric Model (CAM5.1) image data considering seven variables have been generated and employed. Two matrices, peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural index similarity (SSIM) have been used to validate the model performance. The results and analysis show that the proposed idea can effectively improve the cyclone detection and predication.},

abstract={Air pollution is a common cause for several major health hazards and climate change. Air quality predictors are required to plan human activities in a given geographic locality and minimize the negative effects of pollution. We look at the problem of predicting a sequence of future pollutant concentrations. We propose a solution based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are deep neural networks that are known to perform well on sequential prediction problems. We conduct adequate number of experiments to select the best possible features and perform hyperparameter optimization using the Python package Talos. We employ the root mean square error (RMSE) as our performance measure. The presented predictor achieves an RMSE of less than 1.2 for the pollution dataset obtained from Indira Gandhi International Airport at New Delhi, India. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest level of prediction accuracy reported, so far in the literature, for this dataset.},

abstract={India boasts forest and tree cover comprising 24.56% of its total geographical area and an arable land area of 159.7 million hectares. This inevitably calls for the need for fauna management. Tropical and subtropical climates are ideal for the growth and development of pathogens and pests. Although India is a proud home to a huge variety of crops, plants, trees, it also finds virus diseases and their vectors in abundance. Continual usage of antifungal agents, insecticides, and pesticides is increasing the immunogenicity of pathogens. The rapid fluctuations in climate change are also playing a role in increasing disease rates exponentially. Misdiagnosis of disease impacting crops could lead to misuse of chemicals and emergence of resistant pathogen strains, an outbreak of new plant diseases, economic loss, environmental impacts, and increased input costs. Manual inspection and diagnosis are expensive and time inefficient. The application is a deep-learning powered computer vision-aided application that is rendered in a cross platform mobile application that takes charge by examining the disease rate of leaves and provides trend pattern with insightful analysis and accuracy checkpoints towards nurturing better lives for plants.},

title={Estimating Soil Organic Matter Content Using Sentinel-2 Imagery by Machine Learning in Shanghai},
year={2021},
volume={9},

pages={78215-78225},
abstract={Soil organic matter (SOM) plays an important role in the field of climate change and terrestrial ecosystems. SOM in large areas, especially in urban areas, is difficult to monitor and estimate by traditional methods. Urban land structure is complex, and soil is a mixture of organic and inorganic constituents with different physical and chemical properties. Previous studies showed that remote sensing techniques that provide diverse data in the visible-near-infrared (VNIR)-shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral range, are promising in the prediction of SOM content on a large scale. Sentinel-2 covers the important spectral bands (VNIR-SWIR) for SOM prediction with a short revisit time. Thus, this article aimed to evaluate the capacity of Sentinel-2 for SOM prediction in an urban area (i.e., Shanghai). 103 bare soil samples filtrated from 398 soil samples at a depth of 20 cm were selected. Three methods, partial least square regression (PLSR), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM), were applied. The root mean square error (RMSE) of modelling (mRMSE) and the coefficient of determination ( $R^{2}$ ) of modelling $(mR^{2})$ were used to reflect the accuracy of the model. The results show that PLSR has the poorest performance. ANN has the highest modelling accuracy (mRMSE = 7.387 g kg $^{-1}$ , $mR^{2}=0.446$ ). The ANN prediction accuracy of RMSE (pRMSE) is 4.713 g kg $^{-1}$ and the prediction accuracy of $R^{2}~(pR^{2})$ is 0.723. For SVR, the pRMSE is 4.638 g kg $^{-1}$ , and the $pR^{2}$ is 0.732. The prediction accuracy of SVR is slightly higher than that of ANN. The spatial distribution of SOM demonstrates that the value obtained by ANN is the closest to the range of the bare soil samples, and ANN performs better in vegetation-covered areas. Therefore, Sentinel-2 can be used to estimate SOM content in urban areas, and ANN is a promising method for SOM estimation.},

abstract={Water quality has a very important role in the success of shrimp farming. Water as a living medium for shrimp, has a direct effect on the health and growth of shrimp. Water quality determines the existence of various types of organisms in the pond ecosystem, both for shrimp and other biota. Water quality that is far from the optimal value can cause cultivation failure, while optimal water quality can support shrimp growth. This study aims to build a decision support system to help companies manage water quality to get good shrimp farming results. The attributes used are water height, salinity, DO, pH, temperature, alkalinity and target size attributes of shrimp. The data used were 93 data partitioned into 76 training data and 17 testing data. Based on the classification results using the C4.5 algorithm, accuracy was 76.47%, precision was 72.72% and recall was 88.88%. From this study it was proven that the decision support system with the C4.5 algorithm can be used to determine the results of vaname shrimp farming.},

year={2020},

abstract={Remote sensing image classification applications often involve determining which variables are the most important to obtain the best accuracy. Common metrics for assessing variable importance such as a mean decrease in accuracy (MDA) typically provide values in scaled units that are difficult to interpret, and do not easily accommodate user-defined groups of variables. In this letter, an improved method of quantifying the importance of classifier variables is developed and demonstrated in the context of land-cover classification using the random forest algorithm. The proposed method employs concepts from game theory and relies on a metric known as the Shapley value, which allows the importance of variables to be easily interpreted by providing a quantitative assessment of each variable's contribution to classifier accuracy. Moreover, unlike MDA, the method also applies to arbitrary, user-defined groups of variables. The approach described herein thus provides a robust alternative to single-variable selection using MDA and can be used with any type of classifier.},

abstract={The rise of model-based and machine learning methods have created increasingly realistic opportunities to implement personalized, patient-specific mechanical ventilation (MV) in the ICU. These methods require monitoring of real-time patient ventilation waveform data (VWD) during MV treatment. However, there are relatively few non-invasive and/or non-proprietary systems to monitor and record patient-specific lung condition in real-time. In this paper, we present a CARE network data acquisition and monitoring system (CARENet) to automate data collection and to remotely monitor patient-specific lung condition and ventilation parameters. The automated system acquires VWD from a mechanical ventilator using a data acquisition device (DAQ), stores data in network-attached storage (NAS), and processes VWDs via a data management platform (DMP) web application. The web application enables real-time and retrospective model-based monitoring and analysis of clinical MV data. In particular, CARENet provides detailed breath-by-breath patient-specific respiratory mechanics, as well as the overall trends assessing changes in patient condition. Validation testing with a retrospective data set illustrated how breath-to-breath and time-varying patient-ventilator interaction during MV can be monitored, and, in turn, can be used to guide MV treatment. The network data acquisition system design presented is low-cost, open, and enables continuous, automated, scalable, real-time collection and analysis of waveform data, to help improve decision making, care, and outcomes in MV.},

abstract={Weather nowcasting which is the analysis and shortterm weather forecast is a topic of major interest both for the meteorological and machine learning researchers. The problem is a complex one due to the large volume of data (such as radar, satellite or other ground meteorological observations) which has to be analyzed by meteorologists for issuing nowcasting warnings. In addition, climate changes are chaotic and the climate models are complex. The main goal of the paper is to better understand the relationships between the meteorological products extracted from radar observations both in severe and normal weather conditions. Self organizing maps are proposed as unsupervised learning models for detecting hidden patterns in radar data which are well correlated with weather changes. Experiments performed on real radar data provided by the Romanian National Meteorological Administration highlight the potential of unsupervised learning to uncover in radar data hidden rules which are relevant from a meteorological perspective. The results of our study suggest promising results in applying predictive supervised learning models for weather nowcasting based on radar data.},

abstract={Node localization is one of the major challenges that exist in underwater communication. Various techniques exist for terrestrial networks, while few of them are applicable in underwater networks due to the dynamic characteristic of the underwater channels, e.g., the lack of global positioning system (GPS) coverage under the water surface. Moreover, assorted environmental properties affect almost all employed communication techniques. In this letter, we propose an environmental-aware positioning system by considering the variations of the underwater speed of sound according to the dynamic changes in the physical properties of the seawater, such as temperature, salinity, and pressure, besides the internal waves’ effects. The proposed system employs the received signal strength (RSS) technique in estimating the distances between the network nodes. Moreover, we examine the application of various dynamic responses neural networks (NNs) in predicting the underwater node position, such as the feedforward, recurrent, time delay, and distributed delay NNs. The results show that the NN-based prediction models enhance the performance of the positioning system and could achieve small prediction errors in the range of 0.002 for both training and testing patterns.},

In the Greater Lisbon Area, heatwaves (HW) are already frequent, and their severity is expected to aggravate in the coming decades. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to pinpoint the neighborhoods where people are relatively more exposed to the excess heat. In this study, air temperature measurements from citizen owned stations are retrieved from open data sources, quality controlled and co-located with Earth Observation (EO) data to downscale the short-term numerical weather predictions (NWP) from 2.5km up to a metric scale (200m), using a Machine learning (ML) approach. While the NWP model resolves the regional physical processes, the ML model is able to disclose the air temperature response to more detailed local features, such as the urban heat island effect, supporting the local public health stakeholders in their decision-making.},

year={2019},

abstract={Satellite imagery is a rich and structured source of information, yet it is less investigated than everyday images by computer vision researchers. However, bridging modern computer vision with remote sensing data analysis could have critical impact to the way we understand our environment and lead to major breakthroughs in global urban planning or climate change research. Land cover classification is the cornerstone of applications above. It aims at classifying each pixel in a satellite image into a particular land cover category which can be regarded as a multi-class semantic segmentation task. Compared with everyday images, satellite imagery has some different features. Satellite is much bigger than everyday images which means we need more computation resource and a new method to see further. Besides, there are many large well-annotated datasets for everyday images while annotating satellite image is difficult which means we don’t have enough well-annotated satellite images. What’s more, resolution of satellite images is becoming higher and higher which makes it very difficult to classify the pixel’s class. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based on atrous convolution. Atrous convolution means we add null value in convolution kernel. This can increase receptive field (RF) without increasing the compute quantity. Meanwhile, we adopt transfer learning in the network. We use ResNet-101 as backbone network and this works better than initializing the weights randomly. At last, we add graph based fine tuning with BFS in our proposed network for improving the segmentation performance. This operate can reduce the debris caused by high resolution. The evaluation index of the experimental results is mean intersection over union (mIoU). In our experiments, we achieved a 0.4885 mIoU score on the DeepGlobe Dataset and the state-of-art models get 0.433 mIoU score on the same dataset. We demonstrate that our network performs favorably against state-of-art models on the DeepGlobe Dataset.},

abstract={Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision have enabled increased automation in benthic habitat mapping through airborne and satellite remote sensing. Here, we applied deep learning and neural network architectures in NASA NeMO-Net, a novel neural multimodal observation and training network for global habitat mapping of shallow benthic tropical marine systems. These ecosystems, particularly coral reefs, are undergoing rapid changes as a result of increasing ocean temperatures, acidification, and pollution, among other stressors. Remote sensing from air and space has been the primary method in which changes are assessed within these important, often remote, ecosystems at a global scale. However, such global datasets often suffer from large spectral variances due to the time of observation, atmospheric effects, water column properties, and heterogeneous instruments and calibrations. To address these challenges, we developed an object-based fully convolutional network (FCN) to improve upon the spatial-spectral classification problem inherent in multimodal datasets. We showed that with training upon augmented data in conjunction with classical methods, such as K-nearest neighbors, we were able to achieve better overall classification and segmentation results. This suggests FCNs are able to effectively identify the relative applicable spectral and spatial spaces within an image, whereas pixel-based classical methods excel at classification within those identified spaces. Our spectrally invariant results, based on minimally preprocessed WorldView-2 and Planet satellite imagery, show a total accuracy of approximately 85% and 80%, respectively, over nine classes when trained and tested upon a chain of Fijian islands imaged under highly variable day-to-day spectral inputs.},

Ship information is obtained from an Automatic Identification System (AIS) recently installed and managed at the Barcelona School of Nautical Studies. Using as a test case the regular ferry lines connecting Barcelona to Balearic Island, we discuss the robustness and the practical applicability of the methodology.
