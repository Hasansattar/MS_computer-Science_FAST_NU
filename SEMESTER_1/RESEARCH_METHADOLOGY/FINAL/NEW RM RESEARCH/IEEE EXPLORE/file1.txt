abstract={In the last few years we have been witnessing with stupefaction the intensification of the majority of meteorological phenomena as a direct consequence of the global warming of the planet. The latter, occupies a preponderant place in scientific research, to define with precision its present and future repercussions on human life. For this purpose, a continuous and real-time monitoring of the physical quantities characterizing meteorological phenomena is necessary for their good understanding as well as their early detection and the triggering of alarms during emergency situations. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the development of an intelligent electronic sentinel, which will be able to collect, process environmental data to detect those meteorological phenomena that form in its direct vicinity. In this respect, our electronic sentinel will rely on artificial intelligence to enrich these knowledge bases and ensure the veracity of the phenomena it quantifies by avoiding triggering false alarms.},

abstract={The study of climate change has become an important topic because of its negative impact on human life. The North-East African part lacks the studies for climate change detection, despite it being one of the most affected parts worldwide. The relationship between the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate change is an important factor to understand. To investigate this linkage, we used machine-learning (ML) models based on essential climate variables (ECVs) to investigate the relationship between the GHGs and the rhythm of climate variable change. The article investigates how ML techniques can be applied to climatic data to build an ML model that is able to predict the state of climate variables for the short and long term. By selecting a candidate model, it will help in climate adaptation and mitigation, also determine at what level GHGs should be kept and their corresponding concentrations in order to avoid climate events and crises. The used models are long short-term memory, autoencoders, and convolutional neural network (CNN). Alternatively, the dataset has been selected from U.K. National Centre for Earth Observation and Copernicus Climate Change Services. We compared the performance of these techniques and the best candidate was the Head—CNN; based on performance metrics such as root-mean-squared-error: 5.378, 2.395, and 15.923, mean-absolute-error: 4.157, 1.928, and11.672, Pearson: 0.368, 0.649, and 0.291, and R2 coefficient: 0.607, 0.806, and 0.539 for the ECVs temperature, CO2, and CH4, respectively. We were able to link the GHG emission to ECVs with high accuracy based on the reading of this geographic area.},

abstract={Reliable weather forecasting is one of the challenging tasks that deals with a large number of observations and features. In this paper, a data-driven modeling technique is proposed for temperature prediction. To investigate local learning, Soft Kernel Spectral Clustering (SKSC) is used to find similar samples to the test point to be used for training. Due to the high dimensionality, Elastic net is employed as a feature selection approach. Features are selected in each cluster independently and then, Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) regression is used to learn the data. Finally, the predicted values by LS-SVMs are averaged based on the membership of the test point to each cluster. In the experimental results, the performance of the proposed method and “Weather underground” are compared and it is shown that the data-driven technique is competitive with the existing weather temperature prediction sites. For the case study, the prediction of the temperature in Brussels is considered.},

abstract={Globally, species risk assessment plays an significant role in conservation of Biodiversity and ecosystem. The International Union for Conservation of Nature assessed that fourteen percentage of reptiles assessed as a Data Deficient species due to lack of population trend, threat and distribution range size of the species. The lack of data about risk status of species bring to extinction of species from earth. There is an need to build up a tool that in the lack of precise geographic information can assess the risk of extinction. The proposed research presents a statistical framework, that uses Multiple regressions model to estimate the threat level of data-deficient species and species response to climate change and climatic tolerances in pre-adult life stages. The intrinsic and extrinsic trait is correlated with environmental variables to find the significance of predictor independent variable to build the model. The existing methods deficient in knowledge of training data set, while applying full data set getting deprived results, and the existing methods can’t able to predict beyond the limits of the response variable. The predicted risk status of the species applied to IUCN Red list criteria to assign a species into IUCN Red List Category. The predicted information evaluated by using the Receiver operating characteristic, area under curve Sensitivity and Specificity metrics. The predicted result combined with expert knowledge to prioritize species for conservation action.},

abstract={Agriculture is the backbone of a country’s economic system, considering that it not only provides food and raw materials but also employment opportunities for a large percentage of the population. In this way, determining the degree of agricultural vulnerability represents a guide for sustainability and adaptability focused on changing future conditions. In many cases, vulnerability analysis data is restricted to use by authorized personnel only, leaving open data policies aside. Furthermore, data in its native format (raw data) by nature tend to be diverse in structure, storage formats, and access protocols. In addition, having a large amount of open data is important (though not sufficient) to obtain accurate results in data-driven analysis. These data require a strict preparation process and having guides that facilitate this process is becoming increasingly necessary. In this study, we present the step by step processing of several open data sources in order to obtain quality information for feedback on different agricultural vulnerability analysis. The data preparation process is applied to a case study corresponding to the upper Cauca river basin in Colombia. All data sources in this study are public, official and are available from different web platforms where they were collected. In the same way, a ranking with the importance of variables for each dataset was obtained through automatic methods and validated through expert knowledge. Experimental validation showed an acceptable agreement between the ranking of automatic methods and the ranking of raters. The result of this study corresponds to 16 processed data sources ready to feed data-driven systems, as well as agricultural vulnerability methodologies.},

abstract={Projection of changes in extreme indices of climate variables such as temperature and precipitation are critical to assess the potential impacts of climate change on human-made and natural systems, including critical infrastructures and ecosystems. While impact assessment and adaptation planning rely on high-resolution projections (typically in the order of a few kilometers), state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) are available at spatial resolutions of few hundreds of kilometers. Current solutions to obtain high-resolution projections of ESMs include downscaling approaches that consider the information at a coarse-scale to make predictions at local scales. Complex and non-linear interdependence among local climate variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and large-scale predictors (e.g., pressure fields) motivate the use of neural network-based super-resolution architectures. In this work, we present auxiliary variables informed spatio-temporal neural architecture for statistical downscaling. The current study performs daily downscaling of precipitation variable from an ESM output at 1.15 degrees (115 km) to 1/4 degrees (25 km) over one of the most climatically diversified countries, India. We showcase significant improvement gain against two popular state-of-the-art baselines with a better ability to predict statistics of extreme events. To facilitate reproducible research, we make available all the codes, processed datasets, and trained models in the public domain.},
