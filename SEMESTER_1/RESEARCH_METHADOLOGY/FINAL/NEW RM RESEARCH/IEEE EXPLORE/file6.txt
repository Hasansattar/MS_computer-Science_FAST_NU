abstract={The efficiency of road transport is typically influenced by factors such as, weather, choice of road, and time of day, and day of the week. Knowledge about interactions between different traffic-and transport related factors and their influence on the execution of transport is important in transport planning. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of different factors on the performance of road transport. We aim to contribute to improved transport planning by analysing traffic and transport data obtained from different sources in order to support data driven decision making. Through a review of existing literature and discussions with a Swedish road transport operator, we identified factors that could be relevant to consider when planning a transport, e.g., related to weather, location of roads where the transport will take place, and planned time of the transport. As a result of variation in size, type and volume of the data representing these factors, suitable machine learning algorithms were selected, such as Decision Stump, M5 model tree, M5 regression tree, RepTree, M5 rules, and linear regression in order to study the data. Our experimental results illustrate the complexity associated to the performance of road transport systems mainly because of the dependency between the choices of influencing factors and geographic location of the road segment.},

abstract={We review recent advances in distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) and their applications. The scattering mechanisms in glass, which are exploited for reflectometry-based DFOS, are Rayleigh, Brillouin, and Raman scatterings. These are sensitive to either strain and/or temperature, allowing optical fiber cables to monitor their ambient environment in addition to their conventional role as a medium for telecommunications. Recently, DFOS leveraged technologies developed for telecommunications, such as coherent detection, digital signal processing, coding, and spatial/frequency diversity, to achieve improved performance in terms of measurand resolution, reach, spatial resolution, and bandwidth. We review the theory and architecture of commonly used DFOS methods. We provide recent experimental and field trial results where DFOS was used in wide-ranging applications, such as geohazard monitoring, seismic monitoring, traffic monitoring, and infrastructure health monitoring. Events of interest often have unique signatures either in the spatial, temporal, frequency, or wavenumber domains. Based on the temperature and strain raw data obtained from DFOS, downstream postprocessing allows the detection, classification, and localization of events. Combining DFOS with machine learning methods, it is possible to realize complete sensor systems that are compact, low cost, and can operate in harsh environments and difficult-to-access locations, facilitating increased public safety and smarter cities.},

abstract={In this study, we present a research to transfer the merits of SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) to AMSR2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2) with using machine learning method-artificial neural network. The surface soil moisture (SSM) products of SMAP were set as the reference data, while brightness temperature (TB) of various channels and the microwave vegetation index (MVI) obtained or derived from AMSR2 were input into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). During training period (2015–2017), the ANN product (NNsm) can reproduce the SMAP SSM accurately, with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.74, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.033 m3/m3, and Bias of −0.00008 m3/m3. It was found that machine learning method failed to provide reliable SSM over moderate vegetated areas where SMAP works well. With these trained networks, we developed a global soil moisture data set (named as NNsm) using AMSR2 TB from 2012 to 2018. Comparing to the in situ SM observations from all SCAN (Soil Climate Analysis Network) sites (named as SCANsm), NNsm has a good agreement with CC = 0.44, RMSE = 0.113 m3/m3 and Bias = 0.030 m3/m3, which is much better than those of the AMSR2 SSM products from JAXA and LPRM.},

abstract={Location-based services assume significant importance in the Internet of Things (IoT) based systems. In the scenarios where the satellite signals are not available or weak, the Global Positioning System (GPS) accuracy degrades sharply. Therefore, opportunistic signals can be utilized for smart device localization. In this paper, we propose a smart device localization method using residual neural networks. The proposed network is generic and performs smart device localization using opportunistic signals such as Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), geomagnetic, temperature, pressure, humidity, and light signals in the IoT network. Additionally, the proposed method addresses the two significant challenges in IoT based smart device localization, which are noise and device heterogeneity. The experiments are performed on three real datasets of different opportunistic signals. Results show that the proposed method is robust to noise, and a significant improvement in the localization accuracy is obtained as compared to the state-of-the-art localization methods.},

year={2022},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-6},
abstract={In urban regions, where distribution electrical networks tend to rely highly on underground cables, operational reliability indices and maintenance costs strongly depend on the associated cable joint failure rates. As witnessed over the years, climate change has been increasingly contributing to such failures. Based on the field experience compiled systematically by Dubai Electricity & Water Authority distribution networks, this paper studies the seasonal patterns and the impact of various weather conditions on medium voltage underground cable joint failure rates. Among a list of commonly reported weather parameters, the most relevant of them are selected in terms of their impact on cable joint failures. Then, failure data are clustered according to the prominent features and the relative positions of the clusters representing the criticality of the corresponding weather conditions on the underground cable systems, which can be further quantified by predictions on failure rates. The predictive models use historical failure rates combined with the weather data to estimate future failure rates. Then, analyzing the performance of four different machine learning models and assessing the relationship between prediction errors and weather events, we extract useful insights for integrating weather and seasonal data in distribution system operation and planning procedures. One novel aspect of this study lies in geographical area (Middle East) and environmental conditions pertinent to the distribution network, as opposed to previous studies representing European countries and climate zones. Moreover, this work introduces a methodology to assess the association between rainfalls and cable joint failure rates.},

year={2019},
volume={},

pages={1-8},
abstract={Degradation of natural ecosystems as influenced by increasing human activity and climate change is threatening many animal populations in the wild. Zambia’s hippo population in Luangwa Valley is one example where declining forest cover from increased farming pressures has the potential of limiting hippo range and numbers by reducing water flow in this population’s critical habitat, the Luangwa River. COMACO applies economic incentives through a farmer-based business model to mitigate threats of watershed loss and has identified hippos as a key indicator species for assessing its work and the health of Luangwa’s watershed. The goal of this effort is to develop automated machine learning tools that can process fine resolution commercial satellite imagery to estimate the hippo population and associated characteristics of the habitat. The focus is the Luangwa River in Zambia, where the ideal time for imagery acquisition is the dry season of June through September. This study leverages historical commercial satellite imagery to identify selected areas with observable hippo groupings, develop an-image-based signature for hippo detection, and construct an initial image classifier to support larger-scale assessment of the hippo population over broad regions. We begin by characterizing the nature of the problem and the challenges inherent in applying remote sensing methods to the estimation of animal populations. To address these challenges, spectral signatures were constructed from analysis of historical imagery. The initial approach to classifier development relied on spectral angle to distinguish hippos from background, where background conditions included water, bare soil, low vegetation, trees, and mixtures of these materials. We present the approach and the initial classifier results. We conclude with a discussion of next steps to produce an imagebased estimate of the hippo populations and discuss lessons learned from this study.},

year={2019},
volume={},

pages={1-8},
abstract={The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has a significant effect on the global weather and climate variation. Thus, it has widespread scientific research value to enhance prediction skill of the NAO events. The NAO is quantified by the NAO index which can be defined from sea level pressure (SLP), and has the characteristics of changeability and complexity. With the applications of deep learning approaches in the field of climatic prediction, deep neural networks provide the alternative to predict the NAO index beyond numerical models. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM) is used to predict the NAO index sequence. Furthermore, ConvLSTM is used to predict SLP grid data with capturing the temporal and spatial interdependencies. The predicted NAO index can be obtained by projecting output SLP on the NAO anomaly pattern. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, especially for extreme events, we adopt discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to preprocess data, thus DWT-LSTM and DWT-ConvLSTM models are proposed for the NAO index data and SLP grid data respectively. Preprocessing steps include discomposing the input data into the low-frequency and the high-frequency components using DWT along with considering the local time dependency. Observation data is selected as the benchmark, and our models are compared against multiple models, such as support vector regression (SVR), LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU) etc. The experimental results demonstrate that both DWT-LSTM and DWT-ConvLSTM perform better, particularly at peak values. In addition, our models are much closer to observation in multi-step forecasting compared with ensemble forecasts based on numerical models.},

abstract={Solar radiation estimation is one of the integral part of solar power system design. Optimal harvesting of solar radiation is possible if it is estimated well in advance. Radiation measuring devices are found installed at Meteorological Stations. But these stations may not be our region of interest. Due to this limitation, solar radiation estimation models are developed. These models normally accept meteorological parameters like wind speed, ambient temperature, relative humidity, day temperature etc. and geographical entities like latitude, longitude and altitude as input and provide Global Solar Radiation(GSR). These models are statistically tested based on error calculation like MBE, MAE, Root RMSE etc. In this paper brief review of different solar radiation estimation models with methodology used is made. Soft computing based models are reviewed here. From this paper reader will come to know about various techniques used in solar radiation estimation. Study reveals that ANN based models have good performance in comparison to others.},

The ODISEES and OlyMPUS systems rely on an Earth science ontology and metadata repository that provide an ontological framework for describing NASA data holdings with enough detail and fidelity to enable researchers to quickly find and evaluate individual data variables. The Earth Science ontology is a highly precise and robust model of the Earth Science domain, expressed in a formal, logic-based language, that provides a conceptual framework for describing in detail the phenomena (i.e., radiation, aerosols, hydrology, carbon cycles, temperature, cloud properties, etc.) that are the subject of satellite observations and climate modeling, and the measurements of these phenomena that are the subject of NASA data products. To meet the challenges of using NASA big data to address global environmental issues, the Earth science research community needs a rich collaborative environment bringing together data access, computing capability and collaboration tools. The NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) project provides this environment. The NEX is a collaborative platform to increase the capability of researchers to analyze large datasets by staging TB to PB-scale datasets and providing analysis tools to operate on those data, saving time and costs of data transfer. The NEX roadmap calls for incorporating enhanced search capability into NEX to assist scientists in identifying applicable datasets. The ODISEES system is being integrated into the NEX to provide this capability and the ODISEES ontology will be extended to include key NEX datasets such as Landsat.},

year={2020},
volume={8},

pages={52774-52784},
abstract={Deep Learning (DL) is an effective technique for dealing with complex systems. This study proposes a hybrid DL approach, a combination of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) (hereinafter referred to as hybrid Conv1D-MLP model), for multi-step-ahead (1-day to 5-day in advance) daily rainfall prediction. Nine meteorological variables, closely associated with daily rainfall variation, are used as inputs to the hybrid model. The causal variables are obtained from a General Circulation Model (GCM). In general, simulation of meteorological variables from GCM is much better than rainfall estimate and observed records of meteorological variables is sparsely available, if not completely unavailable at many locations. Thus, proposed scheme helps to establish the effectiveness of the DL approach in augmenting the quality of rainfall prediction, exploiting the potential of GCM in simulating meteorological variables. The developed hybrid model is applied to twelve different locations in different climatic regimes in terms of daily precipitation characteristics. The proposed hybrid approach is compared with a DL approach namely, Multi-Layered Perceptron (deep MLP) and another machine learning approach namely, Support Vector Regression (SVR). It is also found that the performance of the model gradually decreases as the prediction lead time (in days) increases. Overall, this study establishes the fact that the hybrid Conv1D-MLP model is more effective in capturing the complex relationship between the causal variables and daily variation of rainfall. The benefit is due to the unification of potentials of individual approaches for extracting the hidden features of hydrometeorological association.},

pages={242-253},
abstract={The risk and damage of wildfires have been increasing due to various reasons including climate change, and the Republic of Korea is no exception to this situation. Burned area mapping is crucial not only to prevent further damage but also to manage burned areas. Burned area mapping using satellite data, however, has been limited by the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite data and classification accuracy. This article presents a new burned area mapping method, by which damaged areas can be mapped using semantic segmentation. For this research, PlanetScope imagery that has high-resolution images with very short revisit time was used, and the proposed method is based on U-Net which requires a unitemporal PlanetScope image. The network was trained using 17 satellite images for 12 forest fires and corresponding label images that were obtained semiautomatically by setting threshold values. Band combination tests were conducted to produce an optimal burned area mapping model. The results demonstrated that the optimal and most stable band combination is red, green, blue, and near infrared of PlanetScope. To improve classification accuracy, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, dissimilarity extracted from Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix, and Land Cover Maps were used as additional datasets. In addition, topographic normalization was conducted to improve model performance and classification accuracy by reducing shadow effects. The F1 scores and overall accuracies of the final image segmentation models are ranged from 0.883 to 0.939, and from 0.990 to 0.997, respectively. These results highlight the potential of detecting burned areas using the deep learning based approach.},

pages={35691-35708},
abstract={There are many pressures on the global food system such as urbanization, climate change, and environmental degradation. Urban agriculture is an approach to producing food inside cities where, globally, more than half the worlds population live. It has been shown to have a range of potential benefits, for instance in reducing waste and logistics costs. Increased uptake of urban farming can even relieve pressure on the natural environment by reducing the burden of production required from farmland by creating space for it to recover from accumulated damage as a result of the use of unsustainable farming practices historically. This article describes an approach for a new type of decision support system suitable for urban farming production. We discuss differences between the requirements and the users of decision support in urban agriculture, and those of ordinary agribusiness enterprises. A case study is performed using a novel technology for urban farming: a cyber-physical implementation of aquaponics is enhanced with adaptive capabilities using a digital twin system and machine learning. Aquaponics is a farming technique that utilizes a harmonious nutrient exchange cycle for growing plants and fish together, while conserving water, and possibly without the need for soil or even sunlight. Empirical results are provided that evaluate the use of data driven decision analytics and a digital twin model to plan production from the aquaponic system during a three month trial. Another set of results evaluate a proposed modelling framework for large scale urban agriculture ecosystems. This concept forms the basis of the suggested approach for an urban farming decision support system that coordinates the activities of many independent producers to target collective goals.},

abstract={Supervised classification of remote sensing data requires a large number of high-quality annotated samples. At the operational level, the definition of a large training set by photograph interpretation is costly and time-consuming. The manual annotation activity is typically supported by high-resolution satellite data. Therefore, when working at country or continental scale, it is necessary to efficiently access large archives of remotely sensed data. To address these issues, this letter presents an interactive strategy implemented in a cloud-computing platform for defining effective training sets with significantly reduced human effort. This is achieved by combining active learning (AL) and self-paced learning (SPL) techniques. First, an initial training set is used to classify the pool of unlabeled samples. Then, the method progressively adds high-confidence samples, selected through an SPL strategy, and low-confidence samples selected considering an AL strategy. While the high-confidence sample labels are self-paced, the low-confidence ones are manually assigned. The cloud-computing platform allows the: 1) definition of a complete training set in a fast and efficient way and 2) access to a multipetabyte catalog of satellite imagery. Experiments carried out on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy compared to the standard manual annotation.},

abstract={Marine vessel traffic is one of the main sources of negative anthropogenic impact upon marine environments. The automatic identification of boats in monitoring images facilitates conservation, research and patrolling efforts. However, the diverse sizes of vessels, the highly dynamic water surface and weather-related visibility issues significantly hinder this task. While recent deep learning (DL)-based object detectors identify well medium- and large-sized boats, smaller vessels, often responsible for substantial disturbance to sensitive marine life, are typically not detected. We propose a detection approach that combines state-of-the-art object detectors and a novel Detector of Small Marine Vessels (DSMV) to identify boats of any size. The DSMV uses a short time series of images and a novel bi-directional Gaussian Mixture technique to determine motion in combination with context-based filtering and a DL-based image classifier. Experimental results obtained on our novel datasets of images containing boats of various sizes show that the proposed approach comfortably outperforms five popular state-of-the-art object detectors.

abstract={Integration of solar generation into power networks can negatively affect the performance of next generation smart energy grids. Rapidly changing output power of this kind is unpredictable and thus one of the solutions is to predict it by computational intelligence techniques. The stochastic component of solar radiation is highly non-linear in nature because of many factors including time of the year, weather conditions, and geographical locations. In order to uncover the underlying phenomenon, three soft computing techniques for solar radiation forecasting based on neural networks (NN) - artificial neural network (ANN), the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) - are implemented and a comparative analysis is performed. Meteorological variables, such as, relative humidity (RH), temperature (T), wind speed (WS), and sunshine duration (SSD) are used as inputs to the NN models. The global horizontal irradiance (GHI) is estimated using ten years data of Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Different statistical performance indicators are computed. Simulation results show that NARX performs relatively better in this case and generalizes the data well. All the models have the tendency to exhibit more error in spring seasons. This leads to further investigations to cater for seasonality components.},

Therefore, a method based on CNN convolution neural network is proposed to detect the composition of electronic ceramic composite materials in batteries. The near-infrared image of the lossless area of the electronic ceramic composite is collected by locating the lossless area of the electronic ceramic composite and keeping the battery in a high temperature state. Through color correction and geometric correction, the near-infrared image is preprocessed, and the image features are extracted. Then the image features are input into CNN convolution neural network to iteratively train and learn the image features and judge the composition of the electronic ceramic composite. The experimental results show that the design method improves the detection accuracy of composite material composition and shortens the detection time.},

Serial–parallel combination dilated convolution enlarges receptive field as well as assemble multi-scale features for multi-scale objects, such as long-span road and small pool. The channel-wise attention mechanism is designed to advantage the context information in the satellite image. The experimental results on road extraction and surface classification data sets prove that the AD-LinkNet shows a significant effect on improving the segmentation accuracy. We defeated the D-Linknet algorithm that won the first place in the CVPR 2018 DeepGlobe road extraction competition.},

abstract={The synergistic use of spatial features with spectral properties of satellite images enhances thematic land cover information, which is of great significance for complex land cover mapping. Incorporating spatial features within the classification scheme have been mainly carried out by applying just low-level features, which have shown improvement in the classification result. By contrast, the application of high-level spatial features for classification of satellite imagery has been underrepresented. This study aims to address the lack of high-level features by proposing a classification framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn deep spatial features for wetland mapping using optical remote sensing data. Designing a fully trained new convolutional network is infeasible due to the limited amount of training data in most remote sensing studies. Thus, we applied fine tuning of a pre-existing CNN. Specifically, AlexNet was used for this purpose. The classification results obtained by the deep CNN were compared with those based on well-known ensemble classifiers, namely random forest (RF), to evaluate the efficiency of CNN. Experimental results demonstrated that CNN was superior to RF for complex wetland mapping even by incorporating the small number of input features (i.e., three features) for CNN compared to RF (i.e., eight features). The proposed classification scheme is the first attempt, investigating the potential of fine-tuning pre-existing CNN, for land cover mapping. It also serves as a baseline framework to facilitate further scientific research using the latest state-of-art machine learning tools for processing remote sensing data.},

year={2021},

pages={5339-5351},
abstract={Ice concentration estimates are typically acquired from algorithms using passive microwave satellite data, and from image analysis charts, but these have limitations. Estimates acquired from passive microwave data have coarse spatial resolution, may have errors due to atmospheric contamination, and often perform poorly in marginal ice zones. Image analysis charts are not as precise, subject to analyst interpretation, and only available over specific geographic areas. We have implemented a U-net with synthetic aperture radar images as inputs and use ice concentration estimates retrieved from passive microwave data as training labels. The U-net, due to not being sensitive to patch size, is shown to be an improvement over previous work with convolutional neural networks that use fully connected layers at the output. Data augmentation and an L1 loss function were applied along with a novel training scheme that leverages curriculum learning. In this training scheme, the model is first trained with samples from open water and consolidated ice regions before incorporating samples from marginal ice regions. In a tenfold cross validation experiment, we achieve 3-4% mean absolute error comparing to estimates using passive microwave data and observe curriculum learning models having more stable training. Predictions on four with-held SAR scenes with difficult ice conditions were evaluated with image analysis charts. A mean absolute error of 7.18% is achieved, which is lower than errors associated with passive microwave data alone. Qualitative improvements in marginal ice zone estimates are achieved, while still preserving smooth consolidated ice regions, and openings in ice cover.},

abstract={In times of climate change, growing world population, and the resulting scarcity of resources, efficient and economical usage of agricultural land is increasingly important and challenging at the same time. To avoid disadvantages of monocropping for soil and environment, it is advisable to practice intercropping of various plant species whenever possible. However, intercropping is challenging as it requires a balanced planting schedule due to individual cultivation time frames. Maintaining a continuous harvest throughout the season is important as it reduces logistical costs and related greenhouse gas emissions, and can also help to reduce food waste. Motivated by the prevention of food waste, this work proposes a flexible optimization method for a full harvest season of large crop ensembles that complies with given economical and environmental constraints. Our approach applies evolutionary algorithms and we further combine our evolution strategy with a sophisticated hierarchical loss function and adaptive mutation rate. We thus transfer the multi-objective into a pseudo-single-objective optimization problem, for which we obtain faster and better solutions than those of conventional approaches.},

abstract={Climate changes, such as overall warmer temperatures, increased rainfall, or increased water scarcity and even more extreme weather events, such as flooding and acute precipitation events have measurable effects on the varied climates found across countries like India. The magnitude of these changes impacts the local conditions and the specific ecology and epidemiology of the different diseases. Climatic conditions strongly affect air-borne, water-borne and vector-borne diseases. They lengthen the transmission seasons of important vector-borne diseases and alter their geographic range. The transmission patterns of communicable diseases are influenced by many factors and diseases tend to get introduced to regions that have not previously encountered them. Therefore capacities need to be built to assess how climate change might alter the effectiveness of proposed programs or might affect future population health so that the cumulative or catastrophic events with large health impacts could be avoided. These evaluations should consider short-term rapid climate change as well as longer-term changes in means of meteorological variables. Mining of such scientific databases is often very different from traditional market-driven data mining applications. It involves datasets comprising vast amounts of precise and continuous data. In such scenarios accounting for underlying system nonlinearities can be extremely challenging from a machine learning point of view. We study the inferences that can be drawn by mining of environmental data and correlating it with the disease data to predict the transmission patterns of communicable diseases.},

pages={577-586},
abstract={Efficient and accurate segmentation of sea ice floes from high-resolution optical (HRO) remote sensing images is crucial for understanding of sea ice evolutions and climate changes, especially in coping with the large data volume. Existing methods suffer from noise interference and the mixture of water and ice caused high segmentation error and less robustness. In this article, we propose a novel sea ice floe segmentation algorithm from HRO images based on texture-sensitive superpixeling and two-stage thresholding. First, sparse components are extracted from the HRO images using the robust principal component analysis (RPCA), and noise is removed by the bilateral filter. The enhanced image is obtained by combining the low-rank matrix and the sparse components. Second, a texture-sensitive simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) superpixel algorithm is introduced for presegmentation of the enhanced HRO image. Third, a learning-based adaptive thresholding in the two stages is employed to generate the refined segmentation from the derived superpixels blocks. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated on two HRO images using visual assessment, quantitative evaluation (with seven metrics), and histogram comparison. The superior performance of the proposed method has demonstrated its efficacy for sea ice floe segmentation.},

volume={69},

pages={1641-1654},
abstract={Second order memristors are two terminal devices that present a conductance depending on two orders of variables, namely the geometric parameters and the internal temperature. They have shown to be able to mimic some specific features of neuron synapses, specifically Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP), and consequently to be good candidates for neuromorphic computing. In particular, memristor crossbar structures appear to be suitable for implementing locally competitive algorithms and for tackling classification problems by exploiting temporal learning techniques. On the other hand, neuromorphic studies and experiments have revealed the existence of different kinds of plasticity and have shown the effect of calcium concentration on synaptic changes. Computational studies have investigated the behavior of spiking networks in the context of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we first derive a simplified, almost analytical, model of a second-order memristor, only involving two variables, the mem-conductance, and the temperature, directly attributable to the synaptic efficacy and to the calcium concentration. Then we study in detail the response of a single memristive synapse to the most relevant plasticity models, including cycles of spike pairs, triplets, and quadruplets at different frequencies. Finally, we accurately characterize memristor spiking networks as discrete nonlinear dynamic systems, with mem-conductances as state variables and pre and postsynaptic spikes as inputs and outputs, respectively. The result shows that the model developed in this manuscript can explain and accurately reproduce a significant portion of observed synaptic behaviors, including those not captured by classical spike pair-based STDP models. Furthermore, under such an approach, the global dynamic behavior of memristor networks and the related learning mechanisms can be deeply analyzed by employing advanced nonlinear dynamic techniques.},

abstract={Deep learning techniques involving image processing and data analysis are constantly evolving. Many domains adapt these techniques for object segmentation, instantiation and classification. Recently, agricultural industries adopted those techniques in order to bring automation to farmers around the globe. One analysis procedure required for automatic visual inspection in this domain is leaf count and segmentation. Collecting labeled data from field crops and greenhouses is a complicated task due to the large variety of crops, growth seasons, climate changes, phenotype diversity, and more, especially, when specific learning tasks require a large amount of labeled data for training. Data augmentation for training deep neural networks is well established, examples include data synthesis, using generative semi-synthetic models, and applying various kinds of transformations. In this paper we propose a data augmentation method that preserves the geometric structure of the data objects, thus keeping the physical appearance of the data-set as close as possible to imaged plants in real agricultural scenes. The proposed method provides state of the art results when applied to the standard benchmark in the field, namely, the ongoing Leaf Segmentation Challenge hosted by Computer Vision Problems in Plant Phenotyping.},

volume={8},

pages={68254-68267},
abstract={In real applications, there is a lack of labeled data to train a proper deep neural network (DNN) model for map generation of remote sensing images. The aim of newly acquired data in spaceborne or airborne platforms is often to consistently observe the Earth for new tasks in the applications such as disaster monitoring, climate change, disease control. To fulfill the tasks, the corresponding classification maps should be obtained traditionally based on the assumption that a classification model should be learnt by the labeled data for the same task from the same scene or at least from the historical labeled remote sensing image pixels provided by domain experts in the same areas by the same sensor, which is denoted as labeled target data. In the paper, a universal deep semantic segmentation lifecycle is proposed against the assumption aforementioned, i.e., there is no need to have the labeled data for the same/similar task from the same locations and sensors to define a proper DNN model. In particular, a general labeled dataset is generated through a feature binding strategy in terms of real-world existed remote sensing images, which is named RSImageNet. In addition, a special training strategy is proposed by using the RSImageNet dataset to train a universal deep semantic segmentation model with a balanced constraint for the loss function. Without the labeled target data from the area observed, we gain an average overall accuracy of 77.32% in the range of 67.28–94.63% on 6 real world datasets by taking advantage of the proposed universal deep semantic segmentation lifecycle and the generated RSImageNet dataset.},

year={2021},

pages={107873-107883},
abstract={Describing ecosystem carbon fluxes is essential for deepening the understanding of the Earth system. However, partitioning net ecosystem exchange (NEE), i.e. the sum of ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP), into these summands is ill-posed since there can be infinitely many mathematically-valid solutions. We propose a novel data-driven approach to NEE partitioning using a deep state space model which combines the interpretability and uncertainty analysis of state space models with the ability of recurrent neural networks to learn the complex functions governing the data. We validate our proposed approach on the FLUXNET dataset. We suggest using both the past and the future of Reco's predictors for training along with the nighttime NEE (NEEnight) to learn a dynamical model of Reco. We evaluate our nighttime Reco forecasts by comparing them to the ground truth NEEnight and obtain the best accuracy with respect to other partitioning methods. The learned nighttime Reco model is then used to forecast the daytime Reco conditioning on the future observations of different predictors, i.e., global radiation, air temperature, precipitation, vapor pressure deficit, and daytime NEE (NEEday). Subtracted from the NEEday, these estimates yield the GPP, finalizing the partitioning. Our purely data-driven daytime Reco forecasts are in line with the recent empirical partitioning studies reporting lower daytime Reco than the Reichstein method, which can be attributed to the Kok effect, i.e., the plant respiration being higher at night. We conclude that our approach is a good alternative for data-driven NEE partitioning and complements other partitioning methods.},

abstract={Long-term and reliable marine ecosystems monitoring is essential to address current environmental issues, including climate change and biodiversity threats. The existing oceans monitoring systems show clear data gaps, particularly when considering characteristics such as depth coverage or measured variables in deep and open seas. Over the last decades, the number of fixed and mobile platforms for in situ ocean data acquisition has increased significantly, covering all oceans’ regions. However, these are largely dependent on satellite communications for data transmission, as well as on research cruises or opportunistic ship surveys, generally presenting a lag between data acquisition and availability. In this context, the creation of a widely distributed network of SMART cables (Science Monitoring And Reliable Telecommunications) - sensors attached to submarine telecommunication cables - appears as a promising solution to fill in the current ocean data gaps and ensure unprecedented oceans health continuous monitoring. The K2D (Knowledge and Data from the Deep to Space) project proposes the development of a persistent oceans monitoring network based on the use of telecommunications cables and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). The approach proposed includes several modules for navigation, communication and energy management, that enable the cost-effective gathering of extensive oceans data. These include physical, chemical, and biological variables, both registered with bottom fixed stations and AUVs operating in the water column. The data that can be gathered have multiple potential applications, including oceans health continuous monitoring and the enhancement of existing ocean models. The latter, in combination with geoinformatics and Artificial Intelligence, can create a continuum from the deep sea to near space, by integrating underwater remote sensing and satellite information to describe Earth systems in a holistic manner.},

abstract={Most importantly the forests play a major role in providing worldwide oxygen and other essentials necessity. Monitoring the forest cover from above the forest canopy level can be easily done by retrieving images from the space satellites. Yet, it’s a great challenge to identify the deforestation as they are more complex. To overcome the complexity, the need of taking images from a considerable height is important. To do this part this research shows that unmanned ariel vehicles as knows as drones can do it conveniently and assist the process accurately. Monitoring the forest cover using drones is accurate but its challenging to break the barriers such as discovering objects and filtrate them to parts to process the correct data to arbitration as output. In this research project planned to design the image processing mechanism to success those mention obstacles to give successful output. To contribute the development of this research project in here using more effective approaches mostly using drones and automated software solution with getting help of less manpower on it. Utilization of the monitoring process is more effective with the real time image processing from the drone footages taken from the targeted site with the help of the software. The research is expecting the final output should be much as effective. Finally, this research project is scoping to track deforestation and we evaluated current literature on drone environmental applications, including forest monitoring, and drew on our own practical experience flying tiny drones to map and monitor tropical forests. Also, this project believes that the use of small drones can assist tropical communities in better managing and conserving the forests, while also benefiting partner organizations, governments, and forest data end-users, particularly those involved in forestry, biodiversity conservation, and climate change.},
