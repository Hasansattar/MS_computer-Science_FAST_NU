abstract={Peatlands occur in ecozones from the tropics to the arctic, and are estimated to globally cover just under 450 million ha, roughly 3-5% of the Earth's land surface [8]. Although they cover a small amount of land globally, peatlands are estimated to store more than 30% of the Earth's soil carbon (C) and are at risk from land use and climate change. An approach of multi-source SAR and optical imagery from multiple dates in machine learning classifiers has demonstrated to be of high value in accurately mapping peatlands from boreal, temperate and tropical regions. Cloud-computing has recently been integrated into a multi-date SAR-optical wetland classification workflow that has high accuracy for peatland mapping. Leveraging the large datasets in Google Earth Engine and Alaska Satellite Facility's OpenSARLabs is improving our capability to access large optical and SAR datasets to integrate into our processing/analysis workflow that was previously cumbersome and time consuming. Such analysis is allowing for larger regional areas to be mapped more efficiently. In this paper we review one study conducted completely outside of cloud computing and two examples of how cloud computing is improving our wetland mapping capability in terms of efficiency, but also in more robust input data sets.},

pages={410-414},
abstract={The prediction of solar radiation (SR) plays a vital role for many applications in renewable energy research. Several parametric and non-parametric machine learning algorithms are being used to predict the SR. In this present study it is proposed to predict monthly global solar radiation (GSR) on a horizontal surface, based on meteorological and geographic variables using different artificial neural network (ANN). ANN based model is applied to 23 Indian locations having different climatic conditions to find most influencing input parameters for SR prediction. The input parameters identified are latitude (Lat), longitude (Long), maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), altitude (Alt), sunshine hours (SH), extraterrestrial radiation (ER) and clearness index (CI) for different cities of India. In order to predict the accurate SR in ANN, three neural networks such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) have been selected. Each network consists of five models. Performance of the models has been evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The most accurate result for the networks RBF, MLP and GRNN are 7.82%, 8.89% and 8.81% in that RBF obtain highly accurate result among others. MAPE yielded promising results and it has been observed that latitude, longitude, altitude, minimum temperature, maximum temperature are the most relevant input parameters to obtain SR.},

pages={4431-4441},
abstract={A support vector machine (SVM), a machine learning technique developed from statistical learning theory, is employed for the purpose of estimating passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperatures over snow-covered land in North America as observed by the advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR-E) satellite sensor. The capability of the trained SVM is compared relative to the artificial neural network (ANN) estimates originally presented in [16]. The results suggest that the SVM outperforms the ANN at 10.65, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz for both vertically and horizontally polarized PMW radiation. When compared against daily AMSR-E measurements not used during the training procedure and subsequently averaged across the North American domain over the 9-year study period, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) in the SVM output is 8 K or less, while the anomaly correlation coefficient is 0.7 or greater. When compared relative to the results from the ANN at any of the six frequency and polarization combinations tested, the RMSE was reduced by more than 18%, while the anomaly correlation coefficient was increased by more than 52%. Furthermore, the temporal and spatial variability in the modeled brightness temperatures via the SVM more closely agrees with that found in the original AMSR-E measurements. These findings suggest that the SVM is a superior alternative to the ANN for eventual use as a measurement operator within a data assimilation framework.},

abstract={Subsurface-intensified eddies are ubiquitous in the world ocean, and they can transport large amounts of heat and salt and influence the three-dimensional distribution of oceanic tracers at a global scale. There is a lack of knowledge of subsurface-intensified eddies due to the lack of global in situ measurement. The correlations between sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST) within eddies can be used to identify whether they are subsurface-intensified eddies. The paper proposes a deep learning-based model for subsurface-intensified eddy detection from multi-source remote sensing images. The newly proposed method can distinguish surface- and subsurface-intensified eddy using fusion data of satellite SSH and SST images.},

abstract={Urban greenspace is an important component of infrastructure providing essential eco-services to the urban community with rapid growth population, in particular, in the context of climate change. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that urban greenspaces are sufficient with proper monitoring and management. In this study, we present urban greenspace mapping in the northern Taiwan derived from the Sentinel-2B imagery. Urban greenspace is classified with support of Google Earth Engine using classification and regression trees for Machine Learning (CART). 360 points were used for training and validation. Land cover is classified into four classes, including 1) dense tree cover, 2) tree cover, 3) water body, and 4) miscellaneous. Later, urban greenspace was further extracted and classified into roadside tree, park, and shrub or grassland. Overall accuracy of classification is 88.6 % with mean kappa coefficient of 0.84. The vulnerability map was generated and ranked into five levels to distinguish the risk patterns and levels of urban greenspace in the northern Taiwan to typhoons. Results further indicate the applicability of Sentinel-2 MSI data as an effective dataset to study urban greenspace at city scale.},

pages={10079-10090},
abstract={Near-surface air temperature (NSAT) is a key parameter in climate changes, environmental ecosystem monitoring, and human settlement issues. As it is difficult for in situ observations to capture the spatial distribution characteristics of NSAT in great detail, various methods have been developed to use remotely sensed land surface temperature and other auxiliary variables to estimate the NSAT. Among them, machine learning turns out to be an exhilarating choice due to its superior performance. However, for long-term dataset estimation, when using machine learning methods with abundant related variables, computation loads and data storage cannot be ignored. Fortunately, Google Earth Engine (GEE) provides a wealth of geospatial datasets and powerful parallel computation capability. In this article, GEE has been utilized to demonstrate the feasibility of estimating long-term 1-km NSAT with two machine-learning models (random forest and deep neural network). After testing the effects of the input variables and the model portability, the 20-year monthly mean 1 km × 1 km NSAT over the Yellow River basin was generated and analyzed. Compared with in situ observations, the overall RMSE, MAE, R2, and R of the NSAT product are 0.429, 0.302, 0.998, and 0.999, respectively. Specifically, for each observation station, R and R2 are greater than 0.997, and RMSE and MAE are smaller than 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. The comparisons with three existing NSAT products show that our product outperforms the other three products. Once again, it is demonstrated in this study that GEE is a powerful platform to generate valuable products with ready-to-use datasets and computation resources.},

abstract={Vegetation phenology is a significance for studying the impact of climate change on ecosystems. Most of the current methods use a single characteristic variable to indirectly measure the vegetation phenology. So the accuracy of the phenological measurement will change due to the accuracy of the measurement index and many other phenological information have not been discovered. In this study, we evaluated leaf phenology using the convolutional neural regression network (CNNR) at a single and multiple sites in deciduous broad-leaved forest (DBF) from PhenoCam cameras. The error of the recognition result of the same site is about 3 days, the R2 of all stations was 0.843, and the error of the RMSE result is about 25 days. These finding provide a certain contribution to the research of vegetation phenology on the scale of daily time detection results.},

abstract={Remote spectral imaging of coastal areas can provide valuable information for their sustainable management and conservation of their biodiversity. Unfortunately, such areas are very sensitive to changes due to human activity, natural phenomenon, introduction of non-native species, and climate change. Thus, the main objective of this research is the implementation of a robust image processing methodology to produce accurate bathymetry maps in shallow coastal waters using high-resolution multispectral WorldView-2/3 satellite imagery for the monitoring at the maximum spatial and spectral resolutions. Two different island ecosystems have been selected for the assessment, since they stand out for their richness in endemic species and they are more vulnerable to climate change: Cabrera National Park and Maspalomas Natural Protected area, located in the Balearic and Canary Islands, Spain, respectively. In addition, a third example to show the applicability of the mapping methodology to monitor the construction of a new port in Granadilla (Canary Islands) is presented. Contributions of this work focus on improving the preprocessing methodology and, mainly, on the proposal and assessment of new satellite-derived regression and machine learning bathymetric models, which have been validated and compared with respect to measured reference bathymetry. After a thorough analysis of nine techniques, using visual and quantitative statistical parameters, ensemble learning approaches have demonstrated excellent performance, even in challenging scenarios up to 35-m depth, with mean RMSE values around 2 m.},

abstract={The prediction and its accuracy of the rainfall is needed due to it would be affected to the various areas of life, such as feasibility aircraft departures and, in general issue, is climate change. This paper aimed to apply a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach to get accurate rainfall forecasting. Also, the LSTM accuracy would be compared to BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network) algorithm. In this research, LSTM architecture used a hidden layer of 200, a maximum epoch of 250, 1 gradient threshold, and learning rates of 0.005, 0.007, and 0.009. Then, standardize data was used gamma γ of 1.05. Then, the BPNN architectures of [2-50-10-1, epoch 250] have been explored. The accuracy performance is measured by the root means square error (RMSE). The experimental results showed that the LSTM had produced a good accuracy than BPNN, with the value of RMSE was 0.2367 and 0.1938. It means that the forecast accuracy of the LSTM approach outperformed the BPNN to predict the rainfall. This finding would be useful for the climatology station to develop a forecsat rainfall application-based artificial intelligence.},

In order to quantify the influence of aerosols on the Earth's climate and to better validate climate models, information about their global abundance, properties and height distribution are needed. We use measurements of the Oxygen A band from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, in conjunction with a machine learning approach, to retrieve aerosol parameters such as optical depth and layer height.

A comprehensive database of the location of solar panels on rooftops is important to assist analysts and policymakers in defining strategies for further expansion of solar energy. The deep learning method was used for the detection of solar panel location and their surface using the aerial imagery. While focusing on light weight image segmentation and low-resolution images, we proposed a two-branch solar panel detection framework consisting of classifier and segmentation branch, which was trained using the public data set of remote sensing images. This work provided an efficient and scalable method to detect solar panels, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97 for classification and intersection over union (IOU) score of 0.84 for segmentation performance.},

abstract={Rising global temperatures over the past decades is directly affecting glacier dynamics. To understand glacier fluctuations and document regional glacier-state trends, glacier-boundary detection is necessary. Debris-covered glacier (DCG) mapping, however, is notoriously difficult using conventional geospatial technology methods. Therefore, in this research for automated DCG mapping, we evaluate the utility of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a deep learning feed-forward neural network. The CNN inputs include Landsat satellite images, an Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) digital elevation model (DEM) and DEM-derived land-surface parameters. Our CNN based deep-learning approach named GlacierNet was designed by appropriately choosing the type, number and size of layers and filters, and encoder depth based on the properties of the input data, CNN segmentation process and empirical results. The GlacierNet was then trained using input data and corresponding glacier boundaries from the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database, and tested on glaciers in the Karakoram and Nepal Himalaya. Our results show proof-of-concept that GlacierNet reasonably identifies the boundaries of DCGs with a relatively high degree of accuracy, and that morphometric parameters improves boundary detection.},

abstract={Solar energy has the greatest potential among the energy sources available in the world and it is clean and universal energy source. The first parameter that should be determined carefully when planning systems based on solar energy is the solar radiation value. The solar radiation values obtained from ground observations can be estimated with various software models. Especially, estimation models designed using emerging computer technology have ease of use and accuracy. In this study, the well-known artificial intelligence techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) are used to estimate solar radiation. The analysis of solar radiation requires complex, lengthy and time consuming procedures and artificial intelligence techniques such as ANN and ANFIS eliminate great effort and time. A system that measures atmospheric data such as light, temperature and humidity using sensors is designed and for this study, measurements were made for over a month. The atmospheric data obtained from the climatic conditions of the province of Karaman and the surface solar radiation values measured using the Pyranometer are utilized to construct these models. As a result of testing the constructed models, the ANFIS model is found to be more successful than ANN.},

year={2022},

pages={1-5},
abstract={As one of the major components in the hydrological system, seasonal snow cover in Northeast China has drawn much attention recently. Because of the coarse spatial resolution of the passive microwave (PMW), heterogeneity of snowpack, and forest cover, it is difficult for existing snow products to achieve high precision snow parameters [e.g., snow depth (SD) or snow water equivalent (SWE)] assessment and hydrological research in fine scale. In this study, a novel SD retrieval algorithm that considered both the spatiotemporal dynamic of snow characteristics and forest attenuation was developed by combining the Calibrated Enhanced-Resolution Brightness Temperature (TB) data and other auxiliary information and produced a fine resolution (i.e., 6.25 km $\times6.25$ km) and high accuracy SD data in Northeast China. Instead of complex physical models, the machine learning was used to untangle the nonlinear complex relationship between SD and the enhanced-resolution TB, forest fraction (FF), and snow characteristics. The verification results at ground weather stations showed that the retrieved SD by the proposed algorithm had high consistency with the observed SD, its RMSE, bias, and correlation coefficient ( $R$ ) of 6.32 cm, −0.23 cm, and 0.63, respectively. Compared with the existing SD products (WESTDC and AMSR2), the developed model greatly improved both spatial resolution and retrieval accuracy. In general, the fine-resolution SD inversion model achieved satisfactory accuracy and stability, and it will be used to generate a long-term SD dataset service for climate change and hydrological research in the future.},

abstract={The mosquito-borne dengue fever is a major public health problem in tropical countries, where it is strongly conditioned by climate factors such as temperature. In this paper, we formulate a holistic machine learning strategy to analyze the temporal dynamics of temperature and dengue data and use this knowledge to produce accurate predictions of dengue, based on temperature on an annual scale. The temporal dynamics are extracted from historical data by utilizing a novel multi-stage combination of auto-encoding, window-based data representation and trend-based temporal clustering. The prediction is performed with a trend association-based nearest neighbour predictor. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is evaluated in a case study that comprises the number of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever cases collected over the period 1985-2010 in 32 federal states of Mexico. The empirical study proves the viability of the proposed strategy and confirms that it outperforms various state-of-the-art competitor methods formulated both in regression and in time series forecasting analysis.},

The results show that the average SSS at the study area is 33.99 psu; generally, the SSS in SCS is lower than NWP about 0-3.3 psu. The distribution pattern of SSS in SCS, showed a decreasing from northeast to southwest during November to next March. The high salt tongue formed northeastern South China Sea (NE-SCS) and the low salinity area located at the southwestern South China Sea (SW-SCS) with the large precipitation and near the estuaries where fresh water was flowed into the sea, especially from April to November. In NWP, a high-salt area is located at the north, where is the extension of the high-salt zone formed by the subtropical high pressure area index of northern hemisphere (SHPAINH) to the study area, and its SSS is highest in April and lowest in September. A sub-high salinity zone is located at the south, where is an extension of the high salinity zone formed by the subtropical high pressure area index of southern hemisphere (SHPAISH), and the SSS is highest in April and lowest in August. The low SSS zone between the two is formed by the low pressure and rainy of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) located north of the equator, and its axis is located near 7°N; in the interior of the low SSS zone, its closed low-salt center is leaning to the west side of Mindanao from December to next July; the low-salt range expands from August to November, and its closed center is leaning toward the Central Eastern Pacific (CEP).

abstract={The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) is a cross-track scanning microwave (MW) radiometer useful to retrieve Temperature (T) and Water Vapor (WV) atmospheric vertical profiles. Using spatial and temporal coincidences between ATMS observations and two different datasets of vertical T and WV, a global training dataset for machine learning purpose was built for the whole 2016. For each ATMS Brightness Temperatures acquisition, 32 levels of T (between 10 and 1000 hPa), and 23 levels of WV (between 200 and 1000 hPa), are used to train an algorithm based on Random Forests regression technique. A single RF was trained for each level and atmospheric variable, using the evaluation on the Out of Bag error to optimize the number of random selection of the input variables at each node splitting step, the number of trees in each forest and the minimum leaf size parameter, to avoid overfitting problem and obtain an accurate retrieval. Considering that the sounding below the precipitation level becomes unreliable, the precipitation-affected observations were removed from the training dataset by means of a pre-screening test based on BT. The results show an overall ability of the algorithm to retrieve T and WV vertical profiles in line with expectations.},

abstract={Water is one of the important natural resources on the earth which is used for various purposes. But human activities and climate change cause reduction of surface water. So water bodies monitoring and management are essential. In recent years, machine learning methods have given better performance than other methods to classify an image. In this study, two machine learning methods - Classification And Regression Trees (CART) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to identify water bodies in Landsat 8 OLI images. The performances of the models are compared with water index methods and evaluated based on overall accuracy, F1 score and kappa coefficient. For machine learning models two test sets are used. One is the samples of own dataset and another is completely new unseen samples to check how the models perform when there are unknown samples. The evaluated result shows that, though CART can achieve higher accuracy among all the methods when samples of own dataset are used, its performance decreased when unseen samples are used. But SVM has given similar performance for both test sets and its accuracy is more than 98%.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been growing interest in using precipitable water vapor (PWV) derived from global positioning system (GPS) signal delays to predict rainfall. However, the occurrence of rainfall is dependent on a myriad of atmospheric parameters. This paper proposes a systematic approach to analyze various parameters that affect precipitation in the atmosphere. Different ground-based weather features such as Temperature, Relative Humidity, Dew Point, Solar Radiation, PWV along with Seasonal and Diurnal variables are identified, and a detailed feature correlation study is presented. While all features play a significant role in rainfall classification, only a few of them, such as PWV, Solar Radiation, Seasonal, and Diurnal features, stand out for rainfall prediction. Based on these findings, an optimum set of features are used in a data-driven machine learning algorithm for rainfall prediction. The experimental evaluation using a 4-year (2012-2015) database shows a true detection rate of 80.4%, a false alarm rate of 20.3%, and an overall accuracy of 79.6%. Compared to the existing literature, our method significantly reduces the false alarm rates.},

year={2022},
volume={60},
number={},
pages={1-11},
abstract={In precipitable water vapor (PWV) retrieval, results with high spatial coverage but low temporal resolution can be achieved through satellite-borne sensors, such as the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). Conversely, the ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) can provide PWV with high temporal resolution and high precision but low spatial coverage. To combine the advantages of these two technologies, we introduce a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) to realize PWV retrieval from AMSR2 with ground-based GNSS data. We first detect the optimal configuration for the BPNN. Then, based on the results of the retrieval accuracy from different types of orbits, we find that the descending (De) orbit has the highest retrieval accuracy, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.25 mm. Afterward, the influence of brightness temperature (Tb) data at different frequencies on PWV retrieval is analyzed. The results of GNSS- PWV verification indicate that the 18 +23-GHz frequency combination has the highest PWV retrieval accuracy, and the mean RMSE of all 82 test stations distributed globally can reach 3.53 mm. We also analyze the influence of differently located stations on retrieval accuracy, and the results show that the accuracy of high-latitude and polar regions is remarkably higher than that of other areas but with a lower relative error. Finally, we use radiosonde data as another external verification method to assess PWV retrieval accuracy. The results reveal that RMSE can reach 3.87 mm. Through a BPNN approach, we have creatively realized PWV retrieval from AMSR2 using ground-based GNSS data on a global scale.},

abstract={The ability to accurately predict ocean-wave conditions is paramount for many maritime activities. A framework comprising a bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) with long-short term memory (LSTM) cells (RNN-LSTM) was developed for timely and accurate predictions of ocean-wave conditions. For comparison, we employed a suite of non-deep learning data-driven techniques to predict significant wave height. To obtain precise predictions, models need accurate and consistent data. The dataset was an aggregation of condition data taken from wave-observing floats (buoys) that recorded readings in increments of 20 and 30 minutes. The buoy measured wave height, wave period, sea surface temperature, and other attributes off the coast of Wilmington, NC. These features were used in various approaches to predict future conditions. Using an RNN-LSTM deep learning methodology, wave conditions were predicted with an average validation accuracy of 81–83%. The Gradient Boosting machine learning model predicted significant wave height with an RMSE of 0.237. This approach has global application as it can be deployed using any sufficient data set collected from wave-monitoring buoys.},

The considered features (RGB and NDVI) are extracted from multitemporal Landsat optical images taken from the freely available Landsat program from 2001 to 2020. The arid region around Jeffara in Medenine (Tunisia) is selected as a study area. The VAE model was evaluated and compared with two deep learning models: convolutional neural network (CNN), convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN_RNN), and VAE without NDVI.

abstract={One of the most important tasks in the advanced transportation systems is road extraction. Extracting road region from high-resolution remote sensing imagery is challenging due to complicated background such as buildings, trees shadows, pedestrians and vehicles and rural road networks that have heterogeneous forms with low interclass and high intraclass differences. Recently, deep learning-based techniques have presented a notable enhancement in the image segmentation results, however, most of them still cannot preserve boundary information and obtain high-resolution road segmentation map when processing the remote sensing imagery. In the present study, we introduce a new deep learning-based convolutional network called VNet model to produce a high-resolution road segmentation map. Moreover, a new dual loss function called cross-entropy-dice-loss (CEDL) is defined that synthesize cross-entropy (CE) and dice loss (DL) and consider both local information (CE) and global information (DL) to decrease the class imbalance influence and improve the road extraction results. The proposed VNet+CEDL model is implemented on two various road datasets called Massachusetts and Ottawa datasets. The suggested VNet+CEDL approach achieved an average F1 accuracy of 90.64% for Massachusetts dataset and 92.41% for Ottawa dataset. When compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning-based frameworks like FCN, Segnet and Unet, the proposed approach could improve the results to 1.09%, 2.45% and 0.39%, for Massachusetts dataset and 7.21%, 1.86% and 2.68%, for Ottawa dataset. Also, we compared the proposed method with the state-of-the-art road extraction techniques, and the results proved that the proposed technique outperformed other deep learning-based techniques in road extraction.},

When using that function, the negative side is completely ignored, while the right side retains the swish part of the function.

A collection of computational intelligence techniques was used to investigate the structure of a large series of Meteosat (ESA) water vapor band (WV6.2) hourly images from 2009 to 2020. These techniques include the Visual Information Fidelity image quality measure, unsupervised and supervised machine learning and explainable AI methods. Explainable AI methods (XAI) like Permutational Variable Importance, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations, Shapley Additive Explanations and Ceteris Paribus profiles, were able to discover temporal variations and changes on the water vapor patterns. The results obtained demonstrate the great potential of ML and XAI in the domain of atmosphere dynamics and weather evolution.},

The model was originally trained and tested in global ocean clear-sky domain for nighttime, and were modified and applied for daytime data in this study. CRTM-simulated brightness temperatures (BTs) were defined as model labels and the clear-sky pixels were identified by an FCDN-trained clear-sky mask (FCDN_CSM) model. The preliminary result showed that the FCDN_CRTM prediction minus CRTM simulation (F-C) mean biases are only up to several tens mK for all bands. However, the corresponding standard deviation (STDs) were 4–5 times worse than training and testing data, due to the effect of the daytime solar reflection. The evaluation result suggested that further fine-tune model is needed to improve the daytime prediction accuracies, by improving input data uniformity, adjusting the model architecture, and selecting possible important features.},

abstract={Accurate flood mapping at global scale can support disaster relief and recovery efforts. Improving flood relief efforts with more accurate data is of great importance due to expected increases in the frequency and magnitude of flood events due to climate change. To assist efforts to operationalize deep learning algorithms for flood mapping at global scale, we introduce Sen1Floods11, a surface water data set including raw Sentinel-1 imagery and classified permanent water and flood water. This dataset consists of 4,831 512x512 chips covering 120,406 km2 and spans all 14 biomes, 357 ecoregions, and 6 continents of the world across 11 flood events. We used Sen1Floods11 to train, validate, and test fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) to segment permanent and flood water. We compare results of classifying permanent, flood, and total surface water from training a FCNN model on four subsets of this data: i) 446 hand labeled chips of surface water from flood events; ii) 814 chips of publicly available permanent water data labels from Landsat (JRC surface water dataset); iii) 4,385 chips of surface water classified from Sentinel-2 images from flood events and iv) 4,385 chips of surface water classified from Sentinel-1 imagery from flood events. We compare these four models to a common remote sensing approach of thresholding radar backscatter to identify surface water. Results show the FCNN model trained on classifications of Sentinel-2 flood events performs best to identify flood and total surface water, while backscatter thresholding yielded the best result to identify permanent water classes only. Our results suggest deep learning models for flood detection of radar data can outperform threshold based remote sensing algorithms, and perform better with training labels that include flood water specifically, not just permanent surface water. We also find that FCNN models trained on plentiful automatically generated labels from optical remote sensing algorithms perform better than models trained on scarce hand labeled data. Future research to operationalize computer vision approaches to mapping flood and surface water could build new models from Sen1Floods11 and expand this dataset to include additional sensors and flood events. We provide Sen1Floods11, as well as our training and evaluation code at: https://github.com/cloudtostreet/Sen1Floods11.},

Under the influence of climate change and human activities, the spatio-temporalattern of surface water is constantly changing, so it is of great significance to monitor its spatiotemporal changes quickly and accurately for the sustainable development of social economy and the management and protection of water resources. The shrinking of surface water bodies in the basin has caused a series of problems such as the degradation of ecological quality and the aggravation of urban heat island phenomenon, which seriously affected the quality of human life. In this paper, taking Erhai Lake Basin as the study area, the water bodies information in 1989,1999,2009 and 2019 is extracted and classified based on long-time Landsat remote sensing images. The temporal and spatial pattern of surface water in Erhai Lake Basin in recent 30 years is obtained, and the relationship between surface water change, climate change and human activities is discussed.},

year={2021},

pages={247-259},
abstract={Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sea ice imagery is a promising source of data for sea ice data assimilation. Classification of SAR sea ice imagery into ice and water is of particular relevance due to its relationship with ice concentration, a key variable in sea ice data assimilation systems. With increasing volumes of SAR data, automated methods to carry out these classifications are of particular importance. Although several automated approaches have been proposed, none look at the impact of including an estimate of uncertainty of the model parameters and input features on the classification output. This article uses an established database of SAR image features to train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify pixel locations as either ice, water, or unknown. The classification accuracies are benchmarked using a recently developed logistic regression approach for the same database. The two methods are found to be comparable. The MLP approach is then enhanced to allow uncertainty to be estimated at each pixel location. Following methods proposed in the deep learning community, two kinds of uncertainty are considered. The first, epistemic uncertainty, is that due to uncertainty in the MLP weights. The second kind of uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, is that which cannot be explained by the model, and is therefore associated with the input data. It is found that including these uncertainties in the MLP models reduces their accuracies slightly, but also reduces misclassification rates. This is of particular importance for data assimilation applications, where misclassifications could severely degrade the analysis.},

abstract={As the effects of climate change are becoming more and more evident, the importance of improved situation awareness is also gaining more attention, both in the context of preventive environmental monitoring and in the context of acute crisis response. One important aspect of situation awareness is the correct and thorough monitoring of air pollutants. The monitoring is threatened by sensor faults, power or network failures, or other hazards leading to missing or incorrect data transmission. For this reason, in this work we propose two complementary approaches for predicting missing sensor data and a combined technique for detecting outliers. The proposed solution can enhance the performance of low-cost sensor systems, closing the gap of missing measurements due to network unavailability, detecting drift and outliers thus paving the way to its use as an alert system for reportable events. The techniques have been deployed and tested also in a low power microcontroller environment, verifying the suitability of such a computing power to perform the inference locally, leading the way to an edge implementation of a virtual sensor digital twin.},

The monitoring can be performed through radar sensors, but current methods aren't efficient enough to process the radar images since they are noisy, and lack quality annotations, which are required by state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. In this work, we show that first learning the thickness of snow layers simulated through a physical model helps in building robust deep learning networks. Specifically we show that transfer learning from a network trained with physics-defined labels improves snow layer thickness estimates by 6-29% on the test set.},

abstract={Temperature is one of the major ecological factors that affect the safe storage of grain. In this paper, we propose a deep spatio-temporal attention mode to predict stored grain temperature, which exploits the historical temperature data of stored grain and the meteorological data of the region. In this proposed model, we use the Sobel operator to extract the local spatial factors, and leverage the attention mechanism to obtain the global spatial factors of grain temperature data and temporal information. In addition, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to learn features of external meteorological factors. Finally, the spatial factors of grain pile and external meteorological factors are combined to predict future grain temperature using long short-term memory (LSTM) based encoder and decoder models. Experiment results show that the proposed model achieves higher predication accuracy compared with the traditional methods.},

title={A Systematic Approach for Variable Selection With Random Forests: Achieving Stable Variable Importance Values},
year={2017},
volume={14},

pages={1988-1992},
abstract={Random Forests variable importance measures are often used to rank variables by their relevance to a classification problem and subsequently reduce the number of model inputs in high-dimensional data sets, thus increasing computational efficiency. However, as a result of the way that training data and predictor variables are randomly selected for use in constructing each tree and splitting each node, it is also well known that if too few trees are generated, variable importance rankings tend to differ between model runs. In this letter, we characterize the effect of the number of trees (ntree) and class separability on the stability of variable importance rankings and develop a systematic approach to define the number of model runs and/or trees required to achieve stability in variable importance measures. Results demonstrate that both a large ntree for a single model run, or averaged values across multiple model runs with fewer trees, are sufficient for achieving stable mean importance values. While the latter is far more computationally efficient, both the methods tend to lead to the same ranking of variables. Moreover, the optimal number of model runs differs depending on the separability of classes. Recommendations are made to users regarding how to determine the number of model runs and/or trees that are required to achieve stable variable importance rankings.},

pages={3626-3636},
abstract={In this study, a machine-learning model was used to produce surface rainfall estimates from Temporal Experiment for Storms and Tropical Systems – Demonstration (TEMPEST-D) microwave radiance observations from a CubeSat. The machine-learning model is based on an artificial neural network (ANN). The space-borne TEMPEST-D sensor performed brightness temperature (TB) observations at five frequencies (i.e., 87, 164, 174, 178, and 181 GHz) during its nearly three-year mission. The TEMPEST-D TBs were used as inputs, and the multiradar/multisensor system (MRMS) radar-only quantitative precipitation estimation product at the surface was used as the ground truth to train the ANN model. A total of 19 storms were identified that were simultaneously observed by TEMPEST-D and ground weather radar over the contiguous United States. The training dataset used 14 of the 19 storm cases. The other five storm cases, consisting of three continental storms and two land-falling hurricanes, were used for independent testing. A spatial alignment algorithm was developed to align the TEMPEST-D observed storm with the ground radar measurement of the storm. This study showed that the TEMPEST-D TBs captured storm features as well as current-generation satellite sensors, such as the global precipitation mission microwave imager. The results of this study demonstrated that the rainfall estimated from TEMPEST-D matches well with the MRMS surface rainfall product in terms of rainfall intensity, area, and precipitation system pattern. The average structural similarity index measure score for the five independent test cases is 0.78.},

Urban air quality monitoring has been a constant challenge with the advent of industrialization. Air pollution has remained a major challenge for the public and the government all over the world. Air pollution causes noticeable damage to the environment as well as to human health resulting into acid rain, global warming, heart diseases and skin cancer to the people. This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI), with the aim to minimize the pollution before it gets adverse, using two Machine Learning Algorithms: Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines. The air pollution databases were extracted from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change, Government of India. The proposed Machine Learning (ML) model is promising in prediction context for the Delhi AQI. The results show improvement of the prediction accuracy and suggest that the model can be used in other smart cities as well.},

abstract={Ocean front plays an important role in marine fishery production and biogeochemical cycling. This letter proposes a multiscale deep framework to meet the need for automatic ocean front detection and fine-grained location. The framework mainly focuses on bringing a well-trained deep learning model into front detection and location on the global satellite sea surface temperature image. First, a multiscale scanner is designed to divide the ocean into small areas of different scales. Then, we introduce the deep model to determine that a front has occurred, and translate the global image into binary ones of various grained. Here, an overlapping scanning way is suggested to locate the front in a small region. Finally, all the binary images are scale-weighted fused into one image, which presents the center and periphery with different brightness levels. Experimental illustrations on three typical areas of the ocean are featured with six scanning scales to show the effectiveness and practical use of the proposed framework. Moreover, the comparison experiments with the traditional method also show its advantages.},

Timely monitoring and assessment of these changes, along with dissemination of accurate information, is important for policy makers, city planners, and humanitarian relief workers. Advances in remote sensing technologies have led to acquisition of very high resolution remote sensing imagery in the past decade. This data is highly useful for the aforementioned applications, and machine learning technology can be used to identify and quantify the changed regions. In this study we explore a semi-supervised deep generative model for change detection in very high resolution multispectral and bitemporal imagery. We constructed an auxiliary variational autoencoder that infers class labels without incurring high sample complexity costs. The resulting classifier was able to produce accurate predictions of real changes over images that appear significantly different due to environmental conditions (not real changes) while utilizing only a small set of labeled samples.},

abstract={Rainfall is a crucial weather parameter in the context of Bangladesh. Prediction of rainfall can effectively aid the decision making process for agriculture and natural disaster management of the country. However the chaotic nature of rainfall due to climate change has made the task of rainfall prediction challenging through traditional statistical models. In this study, we analyze the performance of six machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting (LGB) and Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) in predicting daily rainfall as both regression and classification. In addition we try out an approach called Zero Inflated Regression (ZIR) to address the excessive amount of zero rainfall values in the dataset. The models were trained with and without feature selection and/or sampling techniques (for classification). During training 10-fold cross validation and hyperparameter tuning was performed on the train set and afterwards the selected models were applied to the test set for evaluation. For regression LGB with SelectKBest feature selection had the best performance on the test set with R2-score of 0.203, MAE of 6.40 and RMSE of 15.44. Among the classifiers, XGB with no feature selection and no sampling technique resulted with best test accuracy of 0.787 and test macro fl-score of 0.62. The ZIR model consisting of XGB classifier and LGB regressor with no feature selection yielded R2-score of 0.189, MAE of 5.789 and RMSE of 15.575 on the test set. Interestingly the ZIR models produced lower MAE compared to the regression models but the regression models had better R2-score.},

abstract={Discharge has traditionally seen direct applications of itself for water management. From river embankments to dams, to design and model all, water discharge is required for long-term adaptation to climate change’s effects, including floods. Floods are one of the most common and economically costly natural disasters that, because of climate change, have only intensified in recent months. Predicting floods requires a multitude of factors and parameters, each having its own complexity to deal with, among which, river discharge is always used as a parameter. The advent of technology has led to the creation of many predicting models, but because of the continued advancement of artificial intelligence, new techniques are tested to find more accurate results. Although there are statistical models using which floods are predicted, models that utilize machine learning are increasingly being adopted as Academia is progressively moving towards ML techniques. This work includes numerous Machine Learning algorithms that have been applied to predict river discharge on a time-series dataset. We ran our experiments on the publicly available atmospheric, land, and oceanic climate variable database called ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). The river discharge variable was obtained from GloFAS; both are made available by Europe's Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS). We processed the data over time and the shape of the river basin to allow predictions at a more precise scale. We show that Machine Learning techniques are a good choice in terms of model complexity and performance on this dataset. The top three performing machine learning models are Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boost, and Random Forest. But the only neural network model that is used, Time Delay Neural Network outperforms all the other models.},

Air quality measurements collected over ten years from the air quality station of Zrektouni located in Casablanca (Morocco) are analyzed through the use of three supervised machine learning models: Artificial Neural Networks with back propagation (ANN), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector machines with Regression (SVR). More precisely, daily average of NO2, CO, SO2, O3, temperature, humidity, 850-hPa Geopotential Heights (G-850), precipitation (RR), pression (P), and wind speed (ff) are used as predictors for the PM10 daily average. In order to improve the learning model performances, a resampling strategy with fivefold cross validation and grid search are applied using different statistical indicators. In addition, the learning model results are compared to the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model, which provides comprehensive insights into the relationship between the predictors and PM10. It turns out that the ANN gives the best predictive performance.},

Previous study showed that pest disaster occured from global climate change may cause a tremendous number of trees died and they inevitably became a factor of forest fire. An important portent of the forest fire is the condition of forests. Aerial image-based forest analysis can give an early detection of dead trees and living trees. In this paper, we applied a synthetic method to enlarge imagery dataset and present a new framework for automated dead tree detection from aerial images using a re-trained Mask RCNN (Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) approach, with a transfer learning scheme. We apply our framework to our aerial imagery datasets,and compare eight fine-tuned models. The mean average precision score (mAP) for the best of these models reaches 54%. Following the automated detection, we are able to automatically produce and calculate number of dead tree masks to label the dead trees in an image, as an indicator of forest health that could be linked to the causal analysis of environmental changes and the predictive likelihood of forest fire.},

abstract={Global climate models (GCMs), a primary tool of Numerical weather prediction (NWP) has an irreplaceable position in weather forecasting. Because of the inevitable model error and the coarse resolution, it is necessary to develop the downscaled correction method to reduce the model prediction error and improve the forecast result on the basis of the existing model, especially in the mountains. The Hengduan Mountains (HMs) belongs to the monsoon region accompanied by the highly complex mountainous topography, leading to the accuracy of GCMs limited in this region. The study aims to propose a more accurate deep learning algorithm than the downscaled correction model based on the deep learning method before. In this study, downscaled correction of temperature forecast algorithm with Encoder-Decoder (DCTA-ED) is proposed for downscaling the GCMs results of 2m temperature from coarse grid data to meteorological station point forecast over HMs. The proposed algorithm extracts the interaction between multiple meteorological data and time features of temperature, wind speed, air pressure and humidity from previous position observation, to make the downscaled correction prediction results more consistent with the characteristics of positions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exceeds most of the downscaled correction models for weather stations with different terrains.},

title={Exploiting the ANN Potential in Estimating Snow Depth and Snow Water Equivalent From the Airborne SnowSAR Data at X- and Ku-Bands},

volume={60},
number={},
pages={1-16},
abstract={Within the framework of European Space Agency (ESA) activities, several campaigns were carried out in the last decade with the purpose of exploiting the capabilities of multifrequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to retrieve snow information. This article presents the results obtained from the ESA SnowSAR airborne campaigns, carried out between 2011 and 2013 on boreal forest, tundra and alpine environments, selected as representative of different snow regimes. The aim of this study was to assess the capability of X- and Ku-bands SAR in retrieving the snow parameters, namely snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE). The retrieval was based on machine learning (ML) techniques and, in particular, of artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs have been selected among other ML approaches since they are capable to offer a good compromise between retrieval accuracy and computational cost. Two approaches were evaluated, the first based on the experimental data (data driven) and the second based on data simulated by the dense medium radiative transfer (DMRT). The data driven algorithm was trained on half of the SnowSAR dataset and validated on the remaining half. The validation resulted in a correlation coefficient $R \simeq 0.77$ between estimated and target SD, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) $\simeq 13$ cm, and bias = 0.03 cm. ANN algorithms specific for each test site were also implemented, obtaining more accurate results, and the robustness of the data driven approach was evaluated over time and space. The algorithm trained with DMRT simulations and tested on the experimental dataset was able to estimate the target parameter (SWE in this case) with $R =0.74$ , RMSE = 34.8 mm, and bias = 1.8 mm. The model driven approach had the twofold advantage of reducing the amount of in situ data required for training the algorithm and of extending the algorithm exportability to other test sites.},

abstract={We present NeMO-Net, the first open-source fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) and interactive learning and training software aimed at assessing the present and past dynamics of shallow marine systems through habitat mapping into geomorphological (9 classes) and biological classes (22 classes). Shallow marine systems, particularly coral reefs, are under significant pressures due to climate change, ocean acidification, and other anthropogenic pressures, leading to rapid, often devastating changes, in these fragile and diverse ecosystems. Historically, remote sensing of shallow marine habitats has been limited to meter-scale imagery due to the optical effects of ocean wave distortion, refraction, and optical attenuation. NeMO-Net combines 3D cm-scale distortion-free imagery captured using NASA's airborne FluidCam and fluid lensing remote sensing technology with low resolution airborne and spaceborne datasets of varying spatial resolutions, spectral spaces, calibrations, and temporal cadence in a supercomputer-based deep learning framework. NeMO-Net augments and improves the benthic habitat classification accuracy of low-resolution datasets across large geographic and temporal scales using high-resolution training data from FluidCam. NeMO-Net's FCNN uses ResNet and RefineNet to perform semantic segmentation and cloud masking of remote sensing imagery of shallow marine systems from drones, manned aircraft, and satellites, including FluidCam, WorldView, Planet, Sentinel, and Landsat. Deep Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution Networks (LapSRN) alongside Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (DANNs) are used to augment low resolution imagery with high resolution drone-based datasets as well as recognize domain-invariant features across multiple instruments to achieve high classification accuracies, ameliorating inter-sensor spatial, spectral and temporal heterogeneities. An online active learning and citizen science application is used to allows users to provide interactive training data for NeMO-Net in 2D and 3D, fully integrated within an active learning framework. Preliminary results from a test case in Fiji demonstrate 9-class classification accuracy exceeding 84%.},

abstract={Globally, species risk assessment plays an significant role in conservation of Biodiversity and ecosystem. The International Union for Conservation of Nature assessed that fourteen percentage of reptiles assessed as a Data Deficient species due to lack of population trend, threat and distribution range size of the species. The lack of data about risk status of species bring to extinction of species from earth. There is an need to build up a tool that in the lack of precise geographic information can assess the risk of extinction. The proposed research presents a statistical framework, that uses Multiple regressions model to estimate the threat level of data-deficient species and species response to climate change and climatic tolerances in pre-adult life stages. The intrinsic and extrinsic trait is correlated with environmental variables to find the significance of predictor independent variable to build the model. The existing methods deficient in knowledge of training data set, while applying full data set getting deprived results, and the existing methods can’t able to predict beyond the limits of the response variable. The predicted risk status of the species applied to IUCN Red list criteria to assign a species into IUCN Red List Category. The predicted information evaluated by using the Receiver operating characteristic, area under curve Sensitivity and Specificity metrics. The predicted result combined with expert knowledge to prioritize species for conservation action.},

abstract={Assistive driving is a complex engineering problem and is influenced by several factors such as the sporadic nature of the quality of the environment, the response of the driver, and the standard of the roads on which the vehicle is being driven. The authors track the driver's anticipation based on his head movements using Spatio-Temporal Interest Point (STIP) extraction and enhance the anticipation of action accuracy well before using the RNN-LSTM framework. This research tackles a fundamental problem of lane change assistance by developing a novel model called Advanced Driver's Movement Tracking (ADMT). ADMT uses customized convolution-based deep learning networks by using Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN). STIP with eye gaze extraction and RCNN performed in ADMT on brain4cars dataset for driver movement tracking. Its performance is compared with the traditional machine learning and deep learning models, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and provided an increment of almost 12% in the prediction accuracy and 44% in the anticipation time. Furthermore, ADMT systems outperformed all of the models in terms of both the accuracy of the system and the previously mentioned time of anticipation that is discussed at length in the paper. Thus it assists the driver with additional anticipation time to access the typical reaction time for better preparedness to respond to undesired future behavior. The driver is then assured of a safe and assisted driving experience with the proposed system.},

abstract={Satellite observation is an effective way of obtaining global aerosol information. The study focuses on developing a new scheme to apply the traditional dark target (DT) method to the advanced Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI II), which is a part of the Chinese Fengyun-3-D satellite. Compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), MERSI II shows higher ratios between red (0.65 $\mu \text{m}$ ) and near-infrared ( $2.13~\mu \text{m}$ ) bands in surface reflectance estimation and the green band ( $0.55~\mu \text{m}$ ) that is more sensitive to cloud screening. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is retrieved from earlier MERSI II observations by following the adapted DT method over land in Asia in 2018. Overall, AOD from MERSI II has a good performance compared with ground-based measurements with an expected error (EE%) of 66.38% and $R^{2}$ of 0.834, which is close to the MODIS EE% of 70.59% and $R^{2}$ of 0.829. Both sensors slightly overestimate the AOD over heavy aerosol loading regions, but MERSI-II has larger retrieval area covering a wider swath than MODIS in heavy hazy areas. On a spatial scale, the MERSI II effectively reflects the AOD distribution pattern but tends to overestimate and underestimate AOD at low and high latitudes, respectively, when compared with MODIS. The MERSI II sensor shows good aerosol detection potential, and the DT algorithm can be applied. MERSI II will provide important observation data on climate change and atmospheric pollution for the investigations in the future.},

abstract={The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (ICESat/GLAS) as a full-waveform satellite LiDAR enables land cover classification estimation. Although it has already been retired, its successor satellites will provide valuable information in climate change and icecap glaciology studies. In order to study the way of waveform-based land cover classification using machine learning methods, we utilized decision tree (DT) and Gaussian process (GP) methods to analyze the accuracy of land cover classification. DT classification is a convenient and practical method used in previous reports. GP classification can provide the state-of-the-art recognition performance using an elegant Bayesian framework. To generate the true labels of machine learning classifiers, a solution of the time-matching and location-matching between ICESat/GLAS laser footprints and LANDSAT images has been achieved. Plenty of experiments have been implemented in the Jakobshavn Glacier by evaluating classifiers features selection, training data ratio and classification confusion matrix. Experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the GP classification is solidly higher than DT classification but GP classification consumes more time. At the best training data ratio of 70%, GP classification accuracy is 92.22% which is higher than DT classification accuracy of 87.78%.},

abstract={Floods belong to the most threatening natural hazards for human society and economics, and are enhanced by urbanization and climate change. Integrated assessment is defined as an interdisciplinary and participatory process of combining, integration, interpreting, and communicating knowledge from diverse scientific disciplines to allow a better understanding of complex phenomena. Ontology, as a formal knowledge representation, will provide methods for the interdisciplinary integrated flood assessment. This paper will develop integrated watershed flood risk assessment ontology from different perceptual models of watershed flood risk. First, different conceptual models, such as Pressure-State-Impact-Response model, are introduced. Then the development framework of ontology is given. The flood risk assessment ontology is designed based on the upper level ontology of Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology (SWEET). Finally the rainfall excess indicator computing ontology and vulnerability index computing ontology were given as the examples of application development.},

year={2022},
volume={60},

pages={1-14},
abstract={Sea ice leads in the Arctic Ocean and Antarctic Ocean are of great significance to polar ecology, climate change, and ship navigation. While rule-based remote-sensing classification methods, such as the threshold method, have been widely used for surveying and mapping polar sea ice leads, they have difficulty in overcoming the problems of noise and poor generalization. In this article, we presented an automated, deep learning sea ice open lead detection network in low wind speed conditions, entropy-weighted network (EW-Net). In EW-Net, a dense block was introduced into a U-Net baseline network to strengthen feature propagation, and an entropy sampling structure was designed to improve the pertinence of the network to leads and alleviate the influence of noise. Furthermore, an entropy-weighted feature fusion block was designed to better restore features. EW-Net was trained on the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset in order to obtain lead maps of different polar regions from Sentinel-1 images. The results showed that the proposed EW-Net model was more effective and more generalizable for polar sea ice lead detection than the threshold method and the deep learning methods U-Net and DeepLab V3 Plus, with an overall accuracy (OA) exceeding 0.97. In addition, EW-Net showed advantages in terms of outstanding generalization from cross-sensor image monitoring of leads. The method proposed in this article could be beneficial for providing accurate maps of polar sea ice leads in open water and contribute to further research on polar science.},

abstract={The global long-term aerosol optical depth (AOD) dataset has a great significance for the study of global climate change. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites can provide global observation from 1978 to present. In this paper, we have improved the algorithm for the retrieval of the AOD over land proposed by Xue et al in 2017 [1]. We obtain 0.64μm band surface reflectance by utilizing a linear relationship between the surface reflectance at the wavelength of3.75μm and 0.64μm, which has been verified in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Considering difference of spectral response between AVHRR's bands and MODIS's bands, we calibrate this empirical relationship by fitting the simulated surface reflectance of the relative AVHRR and MODIS bands. A radiative transfer model for Lambertian surface and the look-up table (LUT) method are applied to NOAA-7, 9,11,14, 18 over China mainland (15° - 60° N, 70° - 140° E) from 1982 to 2011. Comparison of retrieval AVHRR AOD against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data shows good consistency with more than 60% points within uncertainty of $\pm$ (0.05+0.25xAOD).},

abstract={The Qinghai–Tibet Railway (QTR) is the highest plateau artificial facility, connecting Lhasa and Golmud over Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Climate change and anthropogenic activities are changing the condition of plateau, with potential influences on the stabilities of QTR. Synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technique could retrieve ground millimeter scale deformation utilizing phase information from SAR images. In this study, the structure and deformation features of QTR are retrieved and analyzed using time-series interferometry with Sentinel-1A and TerraSAR-X images. The backscattering and coherence features of QTR are analyzed in medium and very high-resolution SAR images. Then, the deformation results from different SAR datasets are estimated and analyzed. Experimental results show that some of the QTR sections undergo serious deformation, with the maximum deformation rate of –20 mm/year. Moreover, the detailed deformation feature in the Beiluhe section has been analyzed as well as the effects of different cooling measurements underline QTR embankment. It is also found that embankment-bridge transition section along QTR is prone to undergo deformation. Our study demonstrates the application potential of high-resolution InSAR in deformation monitoring of QTR.},

For this reason, we are developing extensive high-resolution maps of ALT in northern Alaska. We use machine learning along with an extensive set of spatial data layers to upscale ALT from thousands of training pixels taken from high resolution swaths of estimated ALT derived from airborne polarimetric P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The resulting maps of up-scaled ALT have been compared to thousands of validation samples set aside from the PolSAR-derived swaths and to in situ ALT measurements. The maps have achieved root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 5–7 cm relative to validation samples, and RMSEs of approximately 10–12 cm relative to in situ ALT measurements.},

pages={9760-9774},
abstract={Timely and accurate large-scale mapping of the spread of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) is crucial to guarantee food security, study climate change, and monitor operational agriculture. Traditional winter wheat mapping frameworks are constrained by insufficient spatial resolution and heavy dependence on field surveys, while traditional machine learning models excessively rely on subjective judgment. Furthermore, collecting sufficient field samples covering a large area is expensive and time-consuming. In this context, an automatic label update deep learning solution is developed to produce 10-m resolution winter wheat maps using Sentinel-2 data and existing coarse-resolution (30 m) winter wheat mapping products. In particular, a label update module considering the unique phenological (seasonal) characteristics of winter wheat is designed to update labels in the training phase. The results indicate that our method yields a satisfactory classification result with an overall accuracy exceeding 92% and an ${F}_{1}$ score greater than 0.85 for all validation samples, even when no field survey data were used for training. In addition, a 10-m spatial resolution winter wheat map for the entire Shandong province is generated, showing a significant correlation between the computed winter wheat map and the agricultural statistical land, with correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.78 at the municipal and county levels, respectively. The proposed methodology can serve as a viable and promising method for high-resolution, operational agricultural monitoring over large areas.},

abstract={As an important element of the earth's surface, snow cover plays an important role in the global terrestrial ecosystem, climate change, water cycle and energy cycle. Snow depth (SD) provides information on the spatial distribution of snow cover and material energy information. It is also used to study the climatic effects of snow cover, water balance in the basin, snowmelt runoff simulation, and monitoring and evaluation of snow disasters. Snow depth data has become an indispensable basic supporting data in multi-disciplinary research. However, the current snow depth data is relatively poor in completeness and consistency and cannot meet the needs of related scientific research and industry applications, which will bring great confusion to users. This study attempts to use machine learning methods to effectively integrate snow depth data products from multiple sources to obtain a snow depth data set with high consistency in China. This paper chooses the passive microwave remote sensing data (WESTDC), ground-based data (Canadian Meteorological Centre, CMC) and Land surface models (Global Land Data Assimilation System, GLDAS; the NASA Modem-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications MERRA2; the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis, ERA-Interim) as the main SD data source of random forest model, and considering theinfluencing factors (e.g., land cover, snow class, forest cover fraction, surface roughness). The results show that the random forest fusion model method can effectively gather the advantages of each data source, improve the accuracy of snow depth estimation, and reduce the inconsistency between snow depth data from multiple sources. The correlation coefficient between the fused snow depth dataset and the observed snow depth can reach 0.87, and the root mean square error is 5.1 cm. Therefore, the multi-source snow depth fusion using random forest model can improve the accuracy of snow depth estimation.},

abstract={Snow depth (SD) or snow water equivalent in mountainous regions is crucial for hydrology, water resources management, meteorological, and climate research. Remote sensing can be used for SD monitoring on a regional scale or global scale. However, the spaceborne remote sensing of SD in the mountain is challenging because of the sensor sensitivity and spatial resolution problems. Recently, the time series Sentinel-1 is used for SD retrieval in mountains, which shows encouraging accuracy. In this study, an algorithm to estimate the SD in mountainous regions using optical and passive microwave remote sensing observations is proposed, which can be applied in periods before and after the launch of Sentinel-1. The optical and passive microwave remote sensing observations and the Sentinel-1 derived SD in 2016–2021 are used to train the SD retrieval algorithm using the Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm. Validations are performed using the cross-validation method and independent in situ SD data. The cross-validation shows a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 m. The correlation coefficient and MAE of predicted SD and in situ SD in 2002–2016 are 0.61 and 0.33 m, respectively, which shows significantly higher accuracy compared with AMSR-E/AMSR2 SD products. The site dependence of the machine learning method is also discussed. The machine learning-based SD retrieval presented in this study can be applied to mountains globally in the optical and passive microwave remote sensing era.},

abstract={Climate change is making heat waves more frequent, long-lasting, and severe. While multiple satellite types provide data to monitor surface temperature, geostationary (GEO) sensors provide near-continuous, continental-scale observations which can better capture the diurnal variability of land surface temperature (LST) than intermittent observations from low-earth orbit (LEO) sensors. However, standard products from GEO satellites are available at coarsened spatial and temporal resolutions compared to the native sensor resolution. Using datasets from the NASA Earth Exchange, we leveraged co-located, co-temporal observations from LEO and GEO satellites to learn a data-driven mapping using a convolutional neural network. The resulting NASA Earth eXchange Artificial Intelligence LST (NEXAI-LST) achieved a mean absolute error of 1.73 K relative to the target LEO product and improves on both spatial and temporal resolution [2 km, 10 minute] compared to the GEO full disk standard product [10 km, hourly]. In validation against measurements from a ground-based sensor network, NEXAI-LST achieves similar or better fit than both LEO and GEO standard products, while depending none of the prior knowledge of land surface and atmospheric states required by physical-statistical models. Further, application of the model to unseen LEO and GEO satellites demonstrates robust generalization of the model across spatial region, time of day, and sensor. In support of NASA’s open-source science initiative, we make our NEXAI-LST product, model, and codes available to facilitate data exploration and further studies.},

abstract={Temporal and spatial variation of sea ice type in the Arctic is an indicator of regional and global change. Arctic sea ice can be classified into two major categories: multiyear ice (MYI) and first-year ice. In this paper, classification method based on machine learning is established and applied to produce daily sea ice classification data set during the winter (November-April) from 2002 to 2017 using active microwave data from QuikSCAT and Advanced Scatterometer as well as passive microwave data from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS, Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder, and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 radiometer. First, the open water area is flagged out using brightness temperature (Tb) from the passive microwave sensor. Then, K-means algorithm is applied to identify the clusters of the two ice types in the Tb/backscatter parameter space and finally assign pixels to each class. Two optimization methods based on the movement of MYI and marginal ice zone are used to correct the misclassification of MYI. The results have shown a decrease of MYI in winter from 2002 to 2017, especially in 2008 and 2013 with a remarkable recovery in 2014. The classifications are consistent with results by visual interpretation from synthetic aperture radar images in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago with overall classification accuracy over 93%. Comparison with classifications from previous studies and products shows that our method could reflect more differences in MYI declining trend interannually and less anomalous fluctuations in certain years.},

Even with the current technological advancements, weather prediction is one of the most technically and scientifically challenging tasks. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based approach for predicting rainfall for precision agriculture in Sri Lanka and it can be recognized as the first attempt to validate machine learning models to predict the weather in Sri Lankan context for precision agriculture. By analyzing the nature of the weather in Sri Lanka, the relationship of weather attributes with agriculture, availability, and accessibility, seven attributes are selected including rain gauge, relative humidity, average temperature, wind speed, wind direction where solar radiation and ozone concentration are uniquely selected for Sri Lankan context. For the prediction model, cross-validated data are trained and tested with four machine learning algorithms: Multiple Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Currently, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors models have achieved accuracies of 88.57%, 88.66%. Random Forest has been recognized as the best-fitted model with 89.16% accuracy. The results depict a significant accuracy in this novel approach for Sri Lankan weather prediction.},

pages={1-14},
abstract={Air pollution is a central environmental problem in countries around the world. It contributes to climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases, and adversely impacts the health of billions of people. Despite its importance, detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of pollutants is complex to obtain. Ground-level monitoring stations are sparse, and approaches for modeling air pollution rely on extensive datasets which are unavailable for many locations. We introduce three techniques for the estimation of air pollution to overcome these limitations: 1) a baseline localized approach that mimics conventional land-use regression through gradient boosting; 2) an OpenStreetMap (OSM) approach with gradient boosting that is applicable beyond regions covered by detailed geographic datasets; and 3) a remote sensing-based deep learning method utilizing multiband imagery and trace-gas column density measurements from satellites. We focus on the estimation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a common anthropogenic air pollutant with adverse effects on the environment and human health. Our local baseline model achieves strong results with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.18 ± $0.16~\mu \text {g/m}^{3}$ NO2. Substituting localized inputs with OSM leads to a degraded performance (MAE 7.22 ± 0.14) but enables NO2 estimation at a global scale. The proposed deep learning model on remote sensing data combines high accuracy (MAE 5.5 ± 0.14) with global coverage and heteroscedastic uncertainty quantification. Our results enable the estimation of surface-level NO2 pollution with high spatial resolution for any location on Earth. We illustrate this capability with an out-of-distribution test set on the US westcoast. Code1 and data2 are publicly available.},

pages={122-133},
abstract={Image transmission over Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WAN) protocols has always been a difficult task since it necessitates high data rates and high energy consumption. Long Range (LoRa) is one such protocol, which is excellent for transferring data over long distances but has generated severe doubts regarding the viability of image transmission due to its low data rate. This paper demonstrates the application results of an integrated LoRa and Deep Learning-based computer vision system that can efficiently identify grape leaf diseases using low-resolution images. In particular, the focus in this paper is to combine the two technologies, LoRa and Deep Learning, to make the transmission of the images and the identification of the diseases possible. To achieve this objective, the framework utilizes a combination of on-site and simulation experiments along with different LoRa parameters and Convolutional Neural Model (CNN) model fine-tuning. Based on the evaluation, the proposed framework proved that the transmission of images using LoRa is possible within the protocol limitations (such as limited bandwidth and low duty cycle). Our fine-tuned model can efficiently identify grape leaves diseases. The technique is both efficient and adaptive to the specifics of each leaf disease, while it does not need any training data to adjust parameters. It is worth noting that today, end-user trust in Machine and Deep Learning models has increased significantly because of novel solutions in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this study, we use the Grad-CAM method to visualize the output layer judgments of the CNN. The disease’s spot region is highly activated, according to the visualization findings. This is how the network distinguishes between different grape leaf diseases.},

pages={1-8},
abstract={Increasing utility of wireless sensors and their decreasing cost with technological innovation has increased their presence in many mobile & wearable devices and many devices are able to sense and relate a variety of sensor data including GPS location to be used for decision making. However, much potential of this data remains unexploited due to inherent complexity of manipulating such information, which bars the majority of users benefiting from this. One potential application is the detection of anomalies by users from a non-technical background through definition of rules. As such, a methodology/framework, which could enable users to define rules/query information from sensors fused with other contextual data in a user-friendly manner would be highly useful in deriving value from this data. This research attempts to formulate a low-cost framework, which enables users without a strong technical background to make potential use of this. The research is performed using a case study; identification of anomalies in the behaviours and violations of rules by marine vessels in Sri Lankan waters. However, the framework is generalized to enable application to other contexts also. The framework also attempts to identify a possible method and a process to enable users enter geo spatial rules in an accurate as well as user friendly manner while allowing to enter rules of different levels of complexities accurately. The research attempts to solve this problem through the use of a map interface which enables users enter geo spatial data either plotting on a screen or as pairs of coordinates. Use of auto query forms with dynamically changing queries was proposed to enter conditions of rules and the interrelationships. The research was carried out using one prototype and two systems in three stages, using the input of one step to next. Both methods of spatial rule entry were deemed accepted by users considering the ease of use in direct plotting as well as accuracy in formal coordinate entry in the two methods. While auto query form was found as a suitable method with reasonable accuracy with accuracy increasing with the educational background of users and decreasing on several occasions with increased complexity (multiple conditions or ambiguity of underlying concept) of rules, the display of the rule query in user readable form at the bottom of the interface as well as enabling the user to dynamically view query results to refine the query showed increased accuracy.},

title={Pay Attention to Evolution: Time Series Forecasting With Deep Graph-Evolution Learning},
year={2022},
volume={44},

pages={5368-5384},
abstract={Time-series forecasting is one of the most active research topics in artificial intelligence. It has the power to bring light to problems in several areas of knowledge, such as epidemiological studies, healthcare inference, and climate change analysis. Applications in real-world time series should consider two factors for achieving reliable predictions: modeling dynamic dependencies among multiple variables and adjusting the model's intrinsic hyperparameters. An open gap in the literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. The existing applications consistently disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions, named after Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with tens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones. The results outperformed both statistical and ensemble-learning approaches, showing an improvement of 64.87 percent over the competing algorithms on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset of the renowned John Hopkins University for 188 countries simultaneously. For further validation, we tested our architecture in two other public datasets of different domains, the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2012 and Brazilian Weather datasets. We also analyzed the Evolution Weights arising from the hidden layers of ReGENN to describe how the variables of the dataset interact with each other; and, as a result of looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, we concluded that time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.},

abstract={The world is experiencing remarkable climate change, which alters vegetation structural and functional status, and the biosphere feedback to the climate might amplify or dampen regional and global climate change. The exchange of energy and mass across the land-atmosphere interface is an essential indicator of the interaction between ecosystem and environment, and it has been widely measured at landscape scale since the establishment of FLUXNET, a global network of micrometeorological flux measurement sites (Baldocchi, 2008; Baldocchi et al., 2001). Furthermore, these site observations have been upscaled to global scale in conjunction with satellite remote sensing data, providing opportunities to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of carbon and water cycles from a macro perspective (Beer et al., 2010; Martin Jung et al., 2010). However, such upscaling approaches are based on data-driven models, which need to be well calibrated using site observations (M. Jung, Reichstein, & Bondeau, 2009; Papale & Valentini, 2003; Xiao et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2007). Consequently, those models are limited by the representativeness, quantity and quality of the training datasets (Sundareshwar et al., 2006), as well as the lack of independent reference datasets for validation. Furthermore, by using the upscaling approach predictors are directly linked with target fluxes through machine learning, while the intermediate variables along with intrinsic mechanisms are hidden.},

abstract={There is currently a worldwide effort to develop UAS Traffic Management (UTM) systems that help ensure safe and reliable operation of Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) in urban environments. A large number of factors must be considered in planning such flights, including GIS (roads, topography, etc.), weather (temperature, wind, precipitation), localization and navigation (GPS, V2X communication), infrastructure obstacles (buildings, towers, etc.), excluded zones of operation, etc. We have developed a cloud-based geospatial intelligence system, BRECCIA, which brokers such information among a set of intelligent agents. In this work, an extended version of BRECCIA is proposed as a universal-UTM (U-UTM) which allows the specification of urban airways constrained to be above roadways. In addition, we develop a reinforcement learning approach for the determination of optimal flight policies through such airways, where these policies can take into account a variety of factors (wind, precipitation, communication, etc.) which impact UAV path following capabilities. A novel context-based probabilistic state transition function is introduced. Simulation experiments are performed to demonstrate the performance of the approach.},

abstract={Due to climate change and the effects of geopolitical and social challenges like the refugee crisis in Europe, the world is facing an unprecedented set of humanitarian problems. According to the United Nations, there is a projected funding shortfall of more than 20 billion dollars in addressing these needs. Technology can play a vital role in mitigating this burden, especially with the advent of real-time social media and advances in areas like Natural Language Processing and machine learning. An important problem addressed by machine learning in current crisis informatics platforms is situation labeling, which can be intuitively defined as semi-automatically assigning one or more actionable labels (such as food, medicine or water) to tweets or documents from a controlled vocabulary. Despite multiple advances, current situation labeling systems are noisy and do not generalize very well to arbitrary crisis data. Consequentially, consumers of these outputs (which include humanitarian responders) are unwilling to trust these outputs without due diligence or provenance. In this paper, we demonstrate an interactive visualization platform called SAVIZ that provides non-technical first responders with such capabilities. SAVIZ is completely built using open-source technologies, can be rendered on a web browser and is backward-compatible with several pre-existing crisis intelligence platforms. We use two real-world scenarios (the 2015 earthquake in Nepal, and the unfolding Ebola crisis in Africa) to illustrate the potential of SAVIZ.},

abstract={Wetlands, among the most valuable ecosystems, are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic impacts and climate change. Mapping wetland vegetation changes is crucial for conservation, management, and restoration of such sensitive environments. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), kNearest Neighbour (kNN), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are commonly applied for wetland mapping based on remote sensing data. However, scientific literature on this topic is often biased towards limited study areas, and lacking generalization testing over heterogeneous environmental conditions (e.g. latitude, ecoregion, wetland type). In this study, we compared eight ensemble and standalone ML methods, aiming at finding the best performing ones for aquatic vegetation mapping using Sentinel-2 over nine study areas and different seasons. The classifiers were tested to distinguish nine different classes - five aquatic vegetation classes and four background land cover classes – with seasonal monthly composites (April-November) of spectral indices as input. Results suggest that ensemble methods, such as RF, generally show higher predictive power with respect to most of common standalone classifiers (e.g. kNN or DT), which show the highest level of overall disagreement. SVM method overcame all the other classifiers, both standalone and ensemble, over our reference dataset, scoring an overall accuracy of 0.977 ± 0.001; In particular, SVM was the best over transitional aquatic vegetation classes (helophytes and submerged-floating association), which are the ones most frequently misclassified by other methods. Further developments of this research will focus on assessing the influence on classification performance of predictor variables and variations in input features.},

abstract={Ocean eddies, as a ubiquitous phenomenon of the global ocean, are extremely important for ocean energy and material exchanges. Therefore, efficient eddy detection and tracking are crucial for advancing our understanding of ocean dynamics. This work presents a framework for automatic ocean eddy detection and tracking by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. First, we propose a new convolutional neural network model for multieddies detection. This model is capable of extracting accurate boundary information of eddies and fitting the gap between semantic context and sea surface height (SSH). Second, a tracking algorithm is designed to track eddies lasting a number of days and provide visualization of the dynamical processes governing eddies' movements. Finally, we have made our data set publicly available, which is named SCSE-Eddy and can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the performances of artificial intelligence (AI)-based eddy detection methods. The data set covers daily remotely sensed SSH data located in the South China Sea and its eastern sea areas over a period of 15 years. The experimental results show that our methods achieve promising performances compared to existing approaches, especially for the eddies with indistinct geographical border. We believe that this work opens a new avenue for oceanographers to better discover and understand the physical properties of ocean eddies.},

year={2022},
volume={19},

pages={1-5},
abstract={Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is one of the most popular sensors for seismic acquisition. Compared with traditional seismic acquisition technology, DAS has the advantages of full-well coverage, high density, high efficiency, high sensitivity, low cost, strong resistance to high temperature and high pressure, and anti-electromagnetic field interference. However, the DAS vertical seismic profile (VSP) data are contaminated by strong noise interference, which brings challenges for practical applications and difficulties to seismic inversion and interpretation. A deep learning method named U-net with Global Context Block and Attention Block (GC-AB-Unet) is proposed to suppress the background noise and increase the data quality for DAS-VSP records without knowing any prior information. In GC-AB-Unet, several dropout layers are added to the U-net to avoid overfitting. Meanwhile, to speed up the network training, the residual units are set as the output of the network. Furthermore, a global context block (GC-Block) is introduced for better capturing shallow and deep features by extracting global context information. In addition, an Attention Block is used to emphasize seismic event features and restrain irrelevant details in seismic data. We also construct a training dataset by utilizing the synthetic data and real noise of DAS-VSP data. The denoising results for both synthetic data and field DAS-VSP data show that compared to the original U-net and Damped Rank Reduction (DRR) method, the GC-AB-Unet network is able to preserve the effective signals with almost no energy leakage while suppressing a large amount of background noise.},

abstract={Forecasting wind speed is a very important part in weather forecasting. Because of the nonlinear behaviors of nature and climate changes, wind speed prediction becomes a challenging task, particularly country like Bangladesh where lots of areas are costal and season changes in frequent. This study is done to make an attempt to predict the wind speed using two very potential and wide frames of statistical data mining and machine learning approaches; Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with back propagation technique. 7years (2008–2014) historical dataset of wind speed of Chittagong costal area were collected from Bangladesh meteorological division (BMD) for undertaking the experiment. Leaky ReLu function was applied as the rectifier to the input data to control the thresholds and activations of neurons in MLP. The aim of this study was to propose a model that can predict short term wind speed with maximum accuracy. Finally, after considerable amount of experimentations the outcome from this study is; our proposed SVR and ANN models are able to predict wind speed with more than 99% accuracy in short term prediction. Moreover, ANN can outperform SVR in some situations with highest 99.80% accuracy. But SVR models are best suited for overall wind speed forecasting in different horizons with highest 99.60% accuracy. These results outperform the performances of previous recent works that are mentioned in literature review and reference sections of this paper.},

abstract={As the effects of climate change are becoming more and more evident, the correlation between climate and consumption of energy has become a growing concern in the world. Researchers have been exploring possibilities to include weather influence on electricity consumption forecasts. However, no published approaches have been applied to produce accurate predictions of electricity consumption for the Netherlands using dynamic hourly based weather data. One of the reasons could be that those published approaches were developed with data of other countries. This limits their applicability for the case of the Netherlands. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel approach, which uses various weather variables (wind speed, temperature, air pressure, and humidity) measured at different locations in the Netherlands. With dedicatedly designed machine learning architectures, this paper presents a model that incorporates the influences of the dynamic weather variables on hourly-based electricity consumption using only publicly accessible data. The approach was implemented using a common laptop. The accuracy of the proposed approach is also discussed. Future work for developing a practically implementable model to predict the electricity consumption is discussed in the end.},

abstract={The incidence of most diseases varies greatly with seasons, and global climate change is expected to increase its risk. Predictive models that automatically capture trends between climate and diseases are likely to be beneficial in minimizing disease outbreaks. Machine learning (ML) predictive analytic tools have been popularized across many health-care applications, however the optimal task performance of such ML tools largely depends on manual parameter tuning and calibration. Such manual tuning significantly limits the full potential of ML methods, especially for high-dimensional and complex task domains, as typified by real-world health-care application data-sets. Additionally, the inaccessibility of many health-care data-sets compounds innate problems of method comparison, predictive accuracy and the overall advancement of ML based health-care applications. In this study we investigate the impact of Relevance Estimation and Value Calibration, an evolutionary parameter optimization method applied to automate parameter tuning for comparative ML methods (Deep learning and Support Vector Machines) applied to predict daily diarrhoea cases across various geographic regions. Data-augmentation is also used to complement real-world noisy, sparse and incomplete data-sets with synthetic data-sets for training, validation and testing. Results support the efficacy of evolutionary parameter optimization and data synthesis to boost predictive accuracy in the given task, indicating a significant prediction accuracy boost for the deep-learning models across all data-sets.},

In this study, three machine learning models of Stochastic Gradient Boosting (StoGB), Rotation Forest (RotFor), and Bayesian Generalized Linear Model (Bayesglm) are developed for building prediction models and their performance evaluated in the delineation of salinity susceptibility maps. Both natural and human effective factors (16 features) were used as predictors for groundwater salinity modeling and were randomly divided into the training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. The models were evaluated using testing datasets after calibration using the selected features by recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. The RFE indicated that modeling with 8 features had better performance among 1 to 16 features (Accuracy = 0.87). Results of the groundwater salinity prediction highlighted that StoGB had a good performance, whereas the RotFor and Bayesglm had an excellent performance based on the Kappa values (>0.85). Although spatial prediction of the models was different, all of the models indicated that central parts of the region have a very high susceptibility which matches with agricultural areas, lithology map, the locations with low depth to groundwater, low slope, and elevation. Additionally, areas near to the Maharlu lake and locations with a high decline in groundwater are also located in the very high susceptibility zone, which can confirm the effects of saltwater intrusion. The susceptibility maps produced in this study are of utmost importance for water security and sustainable agriculture.},

abstract={Snow avalanche as a natural disaster severely affects socio-economic and geomorphic processes through damaging ecosystems, vegetation, landscape, infrastructures, transportation networks, and human life. Modeling the snow avalanche has been seen as an essential approach for understanding the mountainous landscape dynamics to assess hazard susceptibility leading to effective mitigation and resilience. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to introduce and implement an ensemble machine learning model of random subspace (RS) based on a classifier, functional tree (FT), named RSFT model for snow avalanche susceptibility mapping at Karaj Watershed, Iran. According to the best knowledge of literature, the proposed model, RSFT, has not earlier been introduced and implemented for snow avalanche modeling and mapping over the world. Four benchmark models, including logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMT), alternating decision tree (ADT), and functional trees (FT) models were used to check the goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy of the proposed model. To achieve this objective, the most important factors among many climatic, topographic, lithologic, and hydrologic factors, which affect the snow accumulation and snow avalanche occurrence, were determined by the information gain ratio (IGR) technique. The goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy of the models were evaluated by some statistical-based indexes including, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa, and area under the ROC curve, Friedman and Wilcoxon sign rank tests. Results indicated that the ensemble proposed model (RSFT), had the highest performance (Sensitivity = 94.1%, Specificity = 92.4%, Accuracy = 93.3%, and Kappa = 0.782) rather than the other soft-computing benchmark models. The snow avalanche susceptibility maps indicated that the high and very high susceptibility avalanche areas are located in the north and northeast parts of the study area, which have a higher elevation with more precipitation and lower temperatures.},

Remote Sensing Image Processing is the backbone of agriculture assessment, Global climate change detection, Oceanography, Geology, Intelligence and warfare. Satellites give large number of image data to the base station. The satellite image requires the largest amount of storage space to store and process the image data. In mass storage, feature extraction and classification process is a highly complicated one to get the useful information. So that, this paper is provide an innovative method called Reflection Based Phenology Method (RBPM) to classify the satellite image environment. This method uses Landsat 8 datasets which keep imagery in multispectral. It captures the complete earth images in every 16 days.

abstract={Due to the disruption in the cycles of rainfall, increasing atmospheric temperatures and a rise in CO2 emissions, food security is at a risk globally. This has posed severe threats to food availability, quality, quantity and livelihoods of the stakeholders in the agricultural industry. Thus, an integration of smart and environment friendly systems is inevitable to sustain the natural resources, livelihoods, food production and distribution to thereby ensure food security and mitigate climate change risks. To that end, Smart Agriculture (SA) and Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) augment the existing agricultural systems to adapt to and mitigate changing climatic conditions while ensuring resource utilization optimization. Through the use of latest technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence, Geo-informatics and Big Data analytics, SA and CSA have been widely studied to determine optimal crop health and increase food safety. However, there is a need to analyze the role of SA and CSA in reducing the impact of climate change on food security. This paper presents an analytical review of SA and CSA along with a thorough CSA architectural taxonomy. We also highlight the limitations in the existing literature, and present recommendations to address the open issues.},

abstract={Anomaly detection on large scale spatio-temporal data such as climate data is a challenging task depending on the spatial and temporal resolution and autocorrelation of the data. When considering global gridded daily temperature data, the number of locations and the length of time period considered makes anomaly detection a big data problem. Gaussian Process (GP) Learning is a method that is well-suited to identify the complex spatial and temporal autocorrelation properties of spatio-temporal data. One of the primary challenges with using GP is the computational complexity associated with inverting a covariance matrix. This is further compounded when considering data on a national/global scale and performing anomaly detection using such methods often requires dedicated high performance computing platforms. In this paper, we describe a purely temporal scalable anomaly detection technique for gridded temperature data based on GP Learning that ignore the spatial autocorrelation between neighboring grids and perform anomaly detection on each of the grids in parallel, thereby reducing the execution time. We introduce three methods: a standalone data parallel approach using a single GPU, a distributed memory version on multi-node clusters using MPI, and a mixed parallel approach using multiple GPUs. In comparison to a sequential approach, they are 17.2x, 47.1x, and 88.9x faster, respectively.},

abstract={As climate change getting severer, finding an effective way to establish specie distribution model (SDM) becomes vital, and collecting terrain-related variable is efficient. Chamaecyparis formosensis (Taiwan red cypress, TRC) grow around ridges above 1,800m covered with dry soil or gravel. Abies kawakamii (Taiwan fir, TF) grow near ridges and peaks over 3,000m with impermeable “terrain-shelterbelt” that block away overwhelming moisture. We used digital elevation models (DEM) with four different grid sizes (1, 5, 20, and 40m) to derive variables. We used several types of machine learning algorithms to model SDMs. The most accurate algorithms are decision tree and random forest, and the most suitable resolution is 5m. Elevation and topographic sheltering index are necessary for developing SDMs, and models can be more precise and accurate with using multiple layers of TSIs. As for different species, TRC tends to be majorly influenced by main high ridgeline, and TF is mostly affected by micro terrain.},

abstract={Building upon recent Deep Neural Network architectures, current approaches lying in the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing have achieved unprecedented breakthroughs in tasks like automatic captioning or image retrieval. Most of these learning methods, though, rely on large training sets of images associated with human annotations that specifically describe the visual content. In this paper we propose to go a step further and explore the more complex cases where textual descriptions are loosely related to the images. We focus on the particular domain of news articles in which the textual content often expresses connotative and ambiguous relations that are only suggested but not directly inferred from images. We introduce an adaptive CNN architecture that shares most of the structure for multiple tasks including source detection, article illustration and geolocation of articles. Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis is deployed for article illustration, and a new loss function based on Great Circle Distance is proposed for geolocation. Furthermore, we present BreakingNews, a novel dataset with approximately 100K news articles including images, text and captions, and enriched with heterogeneous meta-data (such as GPS coordinates and user comments). We show this dataset to be appropriate to explore all aforementioned problems, for which we provide a baseline performance using various Deep Learning architectures, and different representations of the textual and visual features. We report very promising results and bring to light several limitations of current state-of-the-art in this kind of domain, which we hope will help spur progress in the field.},

abstract={In the past 50 years, natural disasters worldwide have accounted for 2.06 million deaths and US$3640 billion in economic losses. These natural disasters are heavily influenced by the composite earth system processes and human interactions. In this paper, we focus our investigation to assess the impact of flooding in rivers and coastal regions and its impact on low-income communities. For this purpose, a transdisciplinary perspective from Artificial Intelligence (AI), Climate science, Socio-economics discipline is leveraged to map and identify their inter-relationships and challenges using Soft System Methodology (SSM). A transdisciplinary framework, named ADRELO1 Disaster Support System (ADSS), is therefore proposed to (1) identify the key parameters that can influence climate change, (2) stitch together a reusable multilayered transdisciplinary knowledge model, and (3) apply the observed multivariant data to AI-based algorithm to forecast climate change, analyze the impact of climate change on socio-economic outcomes and suggest potential disaster risk reduction actions. Research-based outcomes, from the given framework, will be used for policy prescription towards making flood-affected local communities self-resilient. ADSS will be applied first in a flood-prone region, such as Nyando in Kenya and Mozambique. It will then be extrapolated in other coastal regions of Florida and North-eastern Brazil to examine the applicability of the framework.},

abstract={The periodic freezing and melting of lake ice can be used as a very important indicator to measure climate change. The Qinghai Tibet Plateau in China is vast, sparsely populated and has poor natural conditions, so it is very difficult to investigate water resources in spots. At the same time, due to the weak economy, the measured hydrological data are relatively scarce. The emergence of high-resolution remote sensing images makes it possible to obtain real-time continuous ground images with low cost, high temporal and spatial resolution and wide coverage, which provides a new opportunity to explore lake ice information. This paper proposes an improved Deeplab v3+ model for water ice extraction, which can effectively reduce the amount of network computing and extract important multi-scale semantic information at the same time. Based on Landsat satellite series remote sensing images, taking Namco Lake as the experimental object, this paper constructs the spatial distribution sequence of lake ice from 2017 to 2020.},

abstract={Globally-covered ocean monitoring system Argo with more than 3,700 floats has been working, and its accumulated big ocean observation data helps many studies such as investigation into climate change mechanism. Since the observed data sometimes involves errors, human experts must visually confirm and revise quality control (QC) labels. However, such manual QC by human experts cannot be performed in some contries. In addition, it is difficult to regularize the quality of the ocean observation data of all over the world because the manual QC depends on human experts' heuristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for error detection in Argo observation data using Conditional Random Field (CRF) to realize an automatic QC with high accuracy equal to human experts. This paper also proposes a feature function design method using decision tree learning. Using decision tree allows coping with various types of observation errors without manual work, whereas previous work had to focus on certain error types due to manual labor for feature function design. Experimental results have shown that the proposed method could detect all types of salinity errors with automatically designed features while maintaining the higher accuracy of QC label assignments than the actually operated system in Argo project and a previous method using CRF with SVM.},

pages={1-11},
abstract={The assimilation of spaceborne passive microwave measurements often suffers from representativeness errors due to the mismatch between the observation footprints and numerical weather prediction (NWP) model grids. In this article, a new brightness temperature remapping technique based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to reduce the representativeness error in FengYun-3D (FY-3D) microwave radiation imager (MWRI) observation data assimilation. The remapping technique uses an adapted dataset construction method in which the training data consist of synthetic NWP-model-grid-based MWRI brightness temperature ( $T_{B}$ ) images and synthetic MWRI-observed antenna temperature ( $T_{A}$ ) images. The synthetic $T_{A}$ and $T_{B}$ , which are generated through radiative transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) model and MWRI degradation model, make the network learn the spatial remapping relationship between observation and background $T_{B}$ in data assimilation. In addition, land–sea mask information is input into the CNN to help the network better analyze the coastline area data. The CNN-based remapped MWRI observation data are evaluated through observation minus background (OMB) diagnosis with the Global/Regional Assimilation and PrEdiction System (GRAPES) four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) system. The experimental results illustrate that the bias and standard deviation of OMB with the CNN-based remapped MWRI observation are quantitatively reduced compared with the raw measurements in GRAPES 4D-Var.},

pages={1-13},
abstract={High spatiotemporal resolution land surface temperature (LST) data are essential for dynamic monitoring and prediction in climate change research. Due to the limitations of remote sensing instruments, the current platforms have difficulty in achieving a compromise between high spatial and temporal resolutions for LST products. In this study, we propose a spatiotemporal fusion network for LST based on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE-LSTFM). First, an improved network is designed based on the CVAE by reconstructing an encoder and a decoder. To generate fine LST images based on dense time series, a variational inference model is formulated to integrate coarse and fine LST image pairs in variational autoencoded latent space. In addition, a new compound loss function for the proposed training method is designed to reduce the effects of noise and outliers. Then, a pretraining mechanism is adopted to optimize the network training process, and the parameters can be transferred to the training network of the CVAE to accelerate network convergence. Finally, a novel weighting strategy that considers spatiotemporal variations in LST (LST consistency weighting) is employed to solve the spatiotemporal heterogeneity problem caused by the rapid changes in LST. The method is quantitatively tested and evaluated in the Heihe River Basin using FY-4A LST and MODIS LST from September 2019. Compared with two traditional models and two deep learning-based models, CVAE-LSTFM yields lower root-mean-square error (RMSE) (average < 1.26 K) and learning perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS, average < 0.13) values and higher structural similarity (SSIM, average $>0.96$ ). In practice, CVAE-LSTFM can generate high spatiotemporal resolution LST values (hourly LST with a 1-km spatial resolution) with high accuracy, quality, and robustness.},

abstract={During the last decades, radar sounders provided direct measurements (radargrams) of the Earth’s polar caps’ subsurface. Radargrams are of critical importance for a better understanding of glaciologic structures and processes of the ice sheet in the framework of climate change. This article aims to automatically extract information on basal boundary conditions given their substantial relevance for modeling the ice-sheet processes, such as the sliding. We introduce a novel automatic method based on deep learning to detect the basal layer and basal units in radargrams acquired in the inland of icy areas. Radargrams are segmented into englacial layers, bedrock, basal units, and noise-limited regions; the latter includes the echo-free zone (EFZ), thermal noise, and signal perturbation. The network is a U-Net with attention gates and the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module that automatically extract semantically meaningful features at different scales. Experimental results on two datasets acquired in north Greenland and west Antarctica by the Multichannel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder (MCoRDS3) indicate a high overall segmentation accuracy. The accuracy of basal ice and signal perturbation detection is high, and that of the other classes is comparable with the literature techniques based on handcrafted features. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in automatically extracting semantically meaningful features to segment radargrams and map the basal layer and basal units.},

abstract={Prediction of ocean parameters is the rising interest in ocean-related fields to perceive variations in climatic conditions. Most of the existing methods reveal that predictions involve a single parameter, namely Sea Surface Temperature (SST). This paper proposed a deep learning technique of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with Multi-Variant Convolutional (MVC) High Speed (HS) Long and short-Term Memory (HM-LSTM) model to predict the four essential parameters - temperature, pressure, salinity and density at three different Oceans -the Bay of Bengal, Arctic Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. The traditional method is limited to time sequence prediction without considering its spatial linkage. The horizontal and vertical parametric variations with spatial and temporal dependencies at 2000 m below the ocean is the observation considerations for the proposed prediction model. The ARGO provides the thermocline, pycnocline, and halocline layers data to perform the parameter prediction. Its results demonstrate the excellent overall accuracy, low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) without any overfitting or underfitting compared to the current State-of-the-art. The forecasting of ocean weather helps conserve the ocean environment for human life in food security, developing the global economy, biomedical exploration, medicines, treatments, diagnostic analysis, and producing a significant passenger transport and tourism source.},
