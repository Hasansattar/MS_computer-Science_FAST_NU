abstract = {Climate is known for being characterised by strong non-linearity and chaotic behaviour. Nevertheless, few studies in climate science adopt statistical methods specifically designed for non-stationary or non-linear systems. Here we show how the use of statistical methods from Information Theory can describe the non-stationary behaviour of climate fields, unveiling spatial and temporal patterns that may otherwise be difficult to recognize. We study the maximum temperature at two meters above ground using the NCEP CDAS1 daily reanalysis data, with a spatial resolution of 2.5° by 2.5° and covering the time period from 1 January 1948 to 30 November 2018. The spatial and temporal evolution of the temperature time series are retrieved using the Fisher Information Measure, which quantifies the information in a signal, and the Shannon Entropy Power, which is a measure of its uncertainty — or unpredictability. The results describe the temporal behaviour of the analysed variable. Our findings suggest that tropical and temperate zones are now characterized by higher levels of entropy. Finally, Fisher-Shannon Complexity is introduced and applied to study the evolution of the daily maximum surface temperature distributions.},

abstract = {With the adjustment of energy supply structure, energy supply is developing in the direction of clean, efficient, low-carbon and energy-saving, promising a strong development momentum the low-temperature radiant heating system that can use geothermal energy, solar energy and industrial waste heat as heat source. Prefabricated concrete structure is not standardized and modularized enough, which leads to more complex design and construction, and also increases the difficulty of popularization and application of prefabricated concrete structure. Compared with traditional radiator heating, low-temperature radiant floor heating has many obvious advantages. In this paper, a new type of prefabricated low-temperature radiant heating floor is proposed. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, the thermal performance of the prefabricated low-temperature radiant heating floor is studied, and its internal structure (including buried pipe depth h, pipe spacing S, pipe layout mode, etc.) is optimized, so as to improve the floor insulation performance, uniform temperature distribution and optimize the radiation surface temperature. The paper also studies the effects of different water supply conditions (water temperature, temperature difference between supply and return water, water supply speed) on the floor surface temperature and surface heat flow. This paper explores the internal heat transfer mechanism of prefabricated low-temperature radiant heating floor, constructs the mathematical model of prefabricated low-temperature radiant heating floor, and constructs the comprehensive evaluation model of surface thermal performance of prefabricated low-temperature radiant heating floor according to the uniformity of surface temperature distribution and heat flow distribution.},

abstract = {Climate prediction is a very challenging problem. Many institutes around the world try to predict climate variables by building climate models called General Circulation Models (GCMs), which are based on mathematical equations that describe the physical processes. The prediction abilities of different GCMs may vary dramatically across different regions and time. Motivated by the need of identifying which GCMs are more useful for a particular region and time, we introduce a clustering model combining Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture of sparse linear regression with Markov Random Fields (MRFs). This model incorporates DP to automatically determine the number of clusters, imposes MRF constraints to guarantee spatio-temporal smoothness, and selects a subset of GCMs that are useful for prediction within each spatio-temporal cluster with a spike-and-slab prior. We derive an effective Gibbs sampling method for this model. Experimental results are provided for both synthetic and real-world climate data.},

abstract = {Effective utilization of novel hybrid architectures of pre-exascale and exascale machines requires transformations to global climate modeling systems that may not reproduce the original model solution bit-for-bit. Round-off level differences grow rapidly in these non-linear and chaotic systems. This makes it difficult to isolate bugs/errors from innocuous growth expected from round-off level differences. Here, we apply two modern multivariate two sample equality of distribution tests to evaluate statistical reproducibility of global climate model simulations using standard monthly output of short (~ 1-year) simulation ensembles of a control model and a modified model of US Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). Both the tests are able to identify changes induced by modifications to some model tuning parameters. We also conduct formal power analyses of the tests by applying them on designed suites of short simulation ensembles each with an increasingly different climate from the control ensemble. The results are compared against those from another such test. These power analyses provide a framework to quantify the degree of differences that can be detected confidently by the tests for a given ensemble size (sample size). This will allow model developers using the tests to make an informed decision when accepting/rejecting an unintentional non-bit-for-bit change to the model solution.},

Digitalization is an integral part of the life of both the population and the economy of the country. The stage of introduction and distribution of high-tech devices in the conditions of Northern latitudes is connected with the historical prerequisites for the development of the Arctic. Currently, digitalization is a priority for the development of the Arctic. The introduction and development of the digital economy in the region is the only correct option for the strategic growth of the Northern region.The purpose of the study is to consider the prerequisites for the introduction and development of digital technologies in the Arctic. Several tasks were set to achieve this goal. The object of the research is the process of implementing digital processes in the Arctic region of the Russian Federation. The subject of research is the characteristic of processes' features that determine their future prospects.The article provides information about the current level of development of the region in the digital economy and high technologies. Problems and possible development prospects are identified. Digital processes will strengthen and improve the economic position of the region and will contribute to further important scientific discoveries.The real driver of the rise of the Russian Arctic can be the construction of data processing centers. Russia has the necessary potential to attract investors, and therefore, experts predict that Russians will significantly improve their positions in the digital services market.},

abstract = {Downscaling is a common task in climate science and meteorology in which the goal is to use coarse scale, spatio-temporal data to infer values at finer scales. Statistical downscaling aims to approximate this task using statistical patterns gleaned from an existing dataset of downscaled values, often obtained from observations or physical models. In this work, we investigate the application of domain alignment to the task of statistical downscaling. We present ClimAlign, a novel method for unsupervised, generative downscaling using adaptations of recent work in normalizing flows for variational inference. We evaluate the viability of our method using several different metrics on two datasets consisting of daily temperature and precipitation values gridded at low (1° latitude/longitude) and high ( and ) resolutions. We show that our method achieves comparable predictive performance to existing supervised statistical downscaling methods while simultaneously allowing for both conditional and unconditional sampling from the joint distribution over high and low resolution spatial fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposed method for unsupervised statistical downscaling, and one of very few proposed methods that allows for efficient sampling of synthetic data.},

By studying weather and climate models of low and medium complexity (the Lorenz system and a shallow water model) we present benefits of posits compared to floats at 16 bit. As a standardised posit processor does not exist yet, we emulate posit arithmetic on a conventional CPU. Using a shallow water model, forecasts based on 16-bit posits with 1 or 2 exponent bits are clearly more accurate than half precision floats. We therefore propose 16 bit with 2 exponent bits as a standard posit format, as its wide dynamic range of 32 orders of magnitude provides a great potential for many weather and climate models. Although the focus is on geophysical fluid simulations, the results are also meaningful and promising for reduced precision posit arithmetic in the wider field of computational fluid dynamics.},

However, because of uneven distribution as well as inadequate number of COVID tests, and also, due to lack of data transparency, these research findings are often found to be contradictory. In order to tackle such data inadequacy and uncertainty issues, in this work, we propose a theory-guided data-driven probabilistic framework with embedded technology of upgrading the impact analysis through incorporated climate domain semantics. Infusion of both the theoretical knowledge from epidemiology and the semantic knowledge from climatological domain helps the framework in better dealing with the uncertainty while appropriately capturing the pandemic characteristics of the disease. The effectiveness of our semantically-enhanced theory-guided data-driven approach is validated in terms of analyzing the causal influence as well as impact of climate variability on COVID-19 outbreak in several states of India.},

Micro climate predictions are of critical importance across various applications, such as Agriculture, Forestry, Energy, Search &amp; Rescue, etc. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other single framework which can accurately predict various micro-climate entities using Internet of Things (IoT)data. We present a generic framework (DeepMC) which predicts various climatic parameters such as soil moisture, humidity, windspeed, radiation, temperature based on the requirement over a period of 12 hours - 120 hours with a varying resolution of 1 hour - 6hours, respectively. This framework proposes the following new ideas: 1) Localization of weather forecast to IoT sensors by fusing weather station forecasts with the decomposition of IoT data at multiple scales and 2) A multi-scale encoder and two levels of attention mechanisms which learns a latent representation of the interaction between various resolutions of the IoT sensor data and weather station forecasts. We present multiple real-world agricultural and energy scenarios, and report results with uncertainty estimates from the live deployment of DeepMC, which demonstrate that DeepMC outperforms various baseline methods and reports 90%+ accuracy with tight error bounds.},

However, as these games remain mostly under-explored, we know little about how students design them and the extent to which they reflect content uptake. Here, we leverage a framework for serious games called Triadic Game Design (TGD) to analyze 391 games on climate science, which were designed by 8th-grade students with Scratch. Based on a large-scale TGD-based analysis, we provide an overview of design outcomes emerging from student games, and analyze how reality, meaning, and play are articulated in these games to reflect content uptake. Then, we ask two experts in game design and education to assess a subset of the 20 most representative games, to reflect on further design and pedagogical insights that may have not been captured by the large-scale analysis. Our results reveal a wide range of design outcomes, where Pong-like games teach players about the ice-albedo feedback loop, and CO2 molecules become targets to be shot in games like Space Invaders. Our work can serve as guidance and inspiration to help both researchers and educators evaluate student-designed games, as well as reason about how to use them as assessment tools in game-based constructionist curricula.},

abstract = {Quantum-assisted sampling is a promising technique to enable training probabilistic ML models, which otherwise depend on slow-mixing classical sampling methods; such as, the use of Quantum Annealing Processors (QAP) to train Boltzmann Machines (BMs). Previous work has shown that QAPs can sample from a Boltzmann distribution, although, at an unknown instance-dependent temperature. Due to this distribution divergence, existing training algorithms have resorted to negative-phase temperature scaling.This method, although effective under arduous tuning, introduces unwanted noise to the sampleset due to the quantization errors caused by the underutilization of the QAP bias ranges; and is prone to bias overflow. We introduce a change in the training algorithm to allow positive-phase temperature scaling; an approach that reduces the impact of quantization noise, while still incorporating temperature scaling. As a result, we see an overall improvement in the convergence rate and testing accuracy, when compared to the state-of-the-art approach.},

The whole chip consists of RF/analog front-end, digital baseband processor, multiple-time-programmable (MTP) memory and an on-chip temperature sensor. A clock generator is proposed to meet the low-power requirement of the fully passive operation, with low sensitivity to the process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. The temperature sensor is realized by using an energy-efficient successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a low power sub-threshold sensing core, where the sensing core generates a proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) voltage signal and a reference voltage, and the PTAT signal is digitized by the SAR ADC. A lower power scheme, which is used to generate the backscatter link frequency (BLF), is also proposed to meet the BLF requirement of EPC Gen2 protocol. The whole temperature sensor tag chip is fabricated in the TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS technology and the chip size is 0.62mm . The maximum sensitivity of the tag is -13.1/-11.3 dBm for reading/sensing operation, and the temperature sensing error is -0.55°C/0.79°C over a operating range from -40°C to 85°C. It achieves a reading/sensing distance of over 8/6 m with 4W effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) by a commercial reader.},

abstract = {As the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) develops, buildings are equipped with increasingly heterogeneous sensors to track building status as well as occupant activities. As users become more and more concerned with their privacy in buildings, explicit sensing techniques can lead to uncomfortableness and resistance from occupants. In this paper, we adapt a sensing by proxy paradigm that monitors building status and coarse occupant activities through agglomerative clustering of indoor temperature movements. Through extensive experimentation on 86 classrooms, offices and labs in a five-story school building in western Europe, we prove that indoor temperature movements can be leveraged to infer latent information about indoor environments, especially about rooms' relative physical locations and rough type of occupant activities. Our results evidence a cost-effective approach to extending commercial building control systems and gaining extra relevant intelligence from such systems.},

abstract = {The short term and small-scale sea surface temperature prediction using deep learning has achieved good results. It is still an important challenge to obtain accurate large-scale and long-term SST predictions. In this study, we used a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to predict the SSTs of the Indian Ocean in the sea area of 40°E -110°E and 25°N to -25°S from 2014 to 2018 at a spatial resolution of 1°\texttimes{}1°. By using the observation data of the previous 10 years to forecast the monthly SSTs of the next 5 years, this study accomplished a 5-year forecast with one model, which had a monthly mean of the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.506°C. In contrast, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration needs to constantly collect observation data and use seven models to make 5-year forecasts. The results showed that the predicted SST through the proposed TCN can better fit the long-term SST variation curve.},

abstract = {Daily observations of Climatic variables such as precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature over a large area exhibit typical spatio-temporal characteristics. Any simulation of these variables must be able to capture such properties. However, dynamical climate models (global or regional) or their surrogate models often miss some of these properties, such as spatial/temporal auto-correlation. In this paper we consider a deep generative approach that combines concepts from probabilistic graphical models, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and variational autoencoders (VaE). One component of this hybrid model is a graphical model based on Markov Random Field which creates a binary representation of the data, and also identifies homogeneous subregions within the concerned spatial field, based on which we do max-pooling operations as in CNN, and get a coarsened and binarized encoded representation of the original data. We train a dense multi-layer network that can reconstruct the original spatial data field from such a code. For simulation of daily spatial patterns, the temporal dynamics is modelled for the coarse binary code, analogous to a VaE. We experimentally show the merits of this hybrid approach for both generating new data and downscaling data from a climate model.},

abstract = {Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (STT-MRAM) is an emerging memory technology, which is seen as a promising replacement for CMOS based on-chip memories. It has several distinctive advantages such as non-volatility, high endurance, high density, CMOS compatibility and scalability among others However retention failure has emerged as a major reliability concern for this technology due to the large variations in retention time because of process variations and temperature effects. The conventional solution to mitigate retention failures is to use scrubbing at regular intervals to prevent accumulation of errors, based on the worst case retention time of the memory array. But this leads to large performance and energy overheads. In this work, we propose a process variation and temperature aware scrubbing technique, where we cluster the cache lines into different groups based on their retention times and use different scrubbing intervals for each of these groups. In addition, the scrubbing interval is adjusted at run-time based on the operating temperature, to guarantee target error rate requirements. Our results show that for a 512KB cache, a group size of 4 can reduce the performance and dynamic energy overheads of scrubbing by 97%, under the same error rate constraint.},

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges to mankind is understanding the underlying principles of climate change. Over the last years, the role of forests in climate change has received increased attention. This is due to the observation that not only the atmosphere has a principal impact on vegetation growth but also that vegetation is contributing to local variations of weather resulting in diverse microclimates. The interconnection of plant ecosystems and weather is described and studied as ecoclimates. In this work we take steps towards simulating ecoclimates by modeling the feedback loops between vegetation, soil, and atmosphere. In contrast to existing methods that only describe the climate at a global scale, our model aims at simulating local variations of climate. Specifically, we model tree growth interactively in response to gradients of water, temperature and light. As a result, we are able to capture a range of ecoclimate phenomena that have not been modeled before, including geomorphic controls, forest edge effects, the Foehn effect and spatial vegetation patterning. To validate the plausibility of our method we conduct a comparative analysis to studies from ecology and climatology. Consequently, our method advances the state-of-the-art of generating highly realistic outdoor landscapes of vegetation.},

abstract = {With the increase in process variations and diversity in workloads, it is imperative to holistically explore optimization techniques for power and temperature from the circuit layer right up to the compiler/operating system (OS) layer. This article proposes one such holistic technique, called proactive workload aware temperature management framework for low-power chip multi-processors (ProWATCh). At the compiler level ProWATCh includes two techniques: (1) a novel compiler design for estimating the architectural parameters of a task at compile time; and (2) a model-based technique for dynamic estimation of architectural parameters at runtime. At the OS level ProWATCh integrates two techniques: (1) a workload- and temperature-aware process manager for dynamic distribution of tasks to different cores; and (2) a model predictive control-based task scheduler for generating the efficient sequence of task execution. At the circuit level ProWATCh implements either of two techniques: (1) a workload-aware voltage manager for dynamic supply and body bias voltage assignment for a given frequency in processors that support adaptive body bias (ABB); or (2) a workload-aware frequency governor for efficient assignment of upper and lower frequency bounds for frequency scaling in processors that do not support an ABB. Employing ProWATCh (with voltage manager) on an ABB-compatible 3D OpenSPARC architecture using MiBench benchmarks resulted in an average 18% (19ˆC) reduction in peak temperature. Evaluating ProWATCh on an existing quad-core Intel Corei7 processor with frequency governor alone (as the processor does not support an ABB interface) resulted in 10% (8ˆC) reduction in peak temperature when compared to what was obtained using the native Linux 3.0 completely fair scheduler (CFS). To study the effectiveness of the proposed framework across benchmark suites, ProWATCh was evaluated on a quad-core Intel Corei7 processor using CPU SPEC 2006 benchmarks which resulted in 7ˆC reduction in peak temperature as compared to the native Linux 3.0 CFS.},

abstract = {Passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags are attractive because they are low cost, battery-free, and easy to deploy. This technology is traditionally being used to identify tags attached to the objects. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of turning passive RFID tags into battery-free temperature sensors. The impedance of the RFID tag changes with the temperature and this change will be manifested in the reflected signal from the tag. This opens up an opportunity to realize battery-free temperature sensing using a passive RFID tag with already deployed Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) RFID reader-antenna infrastructure in supply chain management or inventory tracking. However, it is challenging to achieve high accuracy and robustness against the changes in the environment. To address these challenges, we first develop a detailed analytical model to capture the impact of temperature change on the tag impedance and the resulting phase of the reflected signal. We then build a system that uses a pair of tags, which respond differently to the temperature change to cancel out other environmental impacts. Using extensive evaluation, we show our model is accurate and our system can estimate the temperature within a 2.9 degree centigrade median error and support a normal read range of 3.5 m in an environment-independent manner.},

To design such a system, we propose an innovative microwave leakage sensing procedure and a novel water-equivalent food model to estimate food temperature. To evaluate the real-world performance of RFTemp we build a prototype using software defined radios and conducted experiments on various food items using household microwave ovens. We show that RFTemp can estimate the temperature of the food with a mean error of 5°C, 2x improvement over contactless infrared thermometer and sensors.},

We develop an accurate steady state temperature predictor for thermal management of 3D memories. We utilize the symmetries in the floorplan, along with other design insights, to reduce the predictor’s model parameters, making it lightweight and suitable for runtime thermal management. Using the temperature prediction, we introduce PredictNcool, a proactive thermal management strategy to reduce application runtime and memory energy. We compare PredictNcool with two recent thermal management strategies and our experiments show that the proposed optimization results in performance improvements of 28% and 5%, and memory subsystem energy reductions of 38% and 12% (on average).},

abstract = {Next-generation high-performance computing will require more scalable and flexible performance prediction tools to evaluate software--hardware co-design choices relevant to scientific applications and hardware architectures. We present a new class of tools called application simulators—parameterized fast-running proxies of large-scale scientific applications using parallel discrete event simulation. Parameterized choices for the algorithmic method and hardware options provide a rich space for design exploration and allow us to quickly find well-performing software--hardware combinations. We demonstrate our approach with a TADSim simulator that models the temperature-accelerated dynamics (TAD) method, an algorithmically complex and parameter-rich member of the accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD) family of molecular dynamics methods. The essence of the TAD application is captured without the computational expense and resource usage of the full code. We accomplish this by identifying the time-intensive elements, quantifying algorithm steps in terms of those elements, abstracting them out, and replacing them by the passage of time. We use TADSim to quickly characterize the runtime performance and algorithmic behavior for the otherwise long-running simulation code. We extend TADSim to model algorithm extensions, such as speculative spawning of the compute-bound stages, and predict performance improvements without having to implement such a method. Validation against the actual TAD code shows close agreement for the evolution of an example physical system, a silver surface. Focused parameter scans have allowed us to study algorithm parameter choices over far more scenarios than would be possible with the actual simulation. This has led to interesting performance-related insights and suggested extensions.},

abstract = {Energy and temperature are the main constraints for modern high-performance multi-core systems. To save power or increase performance, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is widely applied in industry. As CMOS technology continues scaling, FinFET has recently become the common choice for multi-core systems. In contrast with planar CMOS, FinFET is observed to have lower delay under higher temperature in super-threshold voltage region, an effect called temperature effect inversion (TEI). Due to this effect, performance can be further improved under power constraints. This work explores TEI-aware performance improvement for power limited multi-core systems. Our experimental results show that on average 15.70% throughput improvement can be achieved in steady state by a TEI-aware DVFS policy over a TEI-agnostic one. In further investigations, we observe multiple sweet spots in the operating voltage/frequency regions resulting from TEI effects. Based on these sweet spot operation regimes, this work introduces a fast algorithm which determines the maximum performance under power constraints. Experimental results confirm its effectiveness by exhibiting a speedup of an average of 45.9X in runtime while keeping resulting performance only 0.22% away from existing state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Most compilers have a single core intermediate representation (IR) (e.g., LLVM) sometimes complemented with vaguely defined IR-like data structures. This IR is commonly low-level and close to machine instructions. As a result, optimizations relying on domain-specific information are either not possible or require complex analysis to recover the missing information. In contrast, multi-level rewriting instantiates a hierarchy of dialects (IRs), lowers programs level-by-level, and performs code transformations at the most suitable level. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for the weather and climate domain. In particular, we develop a prototype compiler and design stencil- and GPU-specific dialects based on a set of newly introduced design principles. We find that two domain-specific optimizations (500 lines of code) realized on top of LLVM’s extensible MLIR compiler infrastructure suffice to outperform state-of-the-art solutions. In essence, multi-level rewriting promises to herald the age of specialized compilers composed from domain- and target-specific dialects implemented on top of a shared infrastructure.},

abstract = {With the advent of 24/7 technology-driven society, there are rising discomforts and increasing concerns over sleep. Quality of sleep critically affects human well-being and everyday performance. A good night's sleep, therefore, is essential to prepare one's mind and body for the next day. In this paper, we propose SleepThermo, a system that identifies the affect of in-cloth monitored body temperature change during sleep on human well-being. The primary purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between in-clothing body temperature and mental/physical conditions, and then elicit positive insights to improve sleep quality. Our evaluation proved that there is a potential for body temperature to be used in identifying mental and physical conditions. In addition, personalized models achieved better balanced accuracy than overall models in all subjects.},

abstract = {We introduce Deep Thermal Imaging, a new approach for close-range automatic recognition of materials to enhance the understanding of people and ubiquitous technologies of their proximal environment. Our approach uses a low-cost mobile thermal camera integrated into a smartphone to capture thermal textures. A deep neural network classifies these textures into material types. This approach works effectively without the need for ambient light sources or direct contact with materials. Furthermore, the use of a deep learning network removes the need to handcraft the set of features for different materials. We evaluated the performance of the system by training it to recognize 32 material types in both indoor and outdoor environments. Our approach produced recognition accuracies above 98% in 14,860 images of 15 indoor materials and above 89% in 26,584 images of 17 outdoor materials. We conclude by discussing its potentials for real-time use in HCI applications and future directions.},
