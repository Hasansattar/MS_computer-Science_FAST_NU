abstract = {While individual behaviour change is considered a central strategy to mitigate climate change, public engagement is still limited. Aiming to raise awareness, and to promote behaviour change, governments and organisations are conducting multiple pro-environmental campaigns, particularly via social media. However, to the best of our knowledge, these campaigns are neither based on, nor do they take advantage of, the existing theories and studies of behaviour change, to better target and inform users. In this paper we propose an approach for analysing user behaviour towards climate change based on the 5 Doors Theory of behaviour change [19]. Our approach automatically identifies five behavioural stages in which users are based on their social media contributions. This approach has been applied to analyse the online behaviour of participants of the Earth Hour 2015 and COP21 Twitter movements. Results of our analysis are used to provide guidelines on how to improve communication via these campaigns.},

abstract = {Climate change or global warming is a global threat to both human communities and natural systems. In recent years, there is an increasingly public debate on the existence of climate change or global warming, but data describing such discussions are difficult to access. Social media provide a new data source to survey public perceptions and attitudes toward such topics. However, enabling computers to automatically determine users' attitudes towards climate change based on social media contents is still challenging. Taking Twitter data as an example, this study analyzed public discussions about climate change and global warming in year 2016. The objectives are: (1) to develop an optimized Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier to identify users who are climate change deniers based on tweet contents; (2) to examine the temporal patterns of climate change discussions on Twitter and its driving factors. Results demonstrate that the developed DNN model successfully identified climate change deniers based on tweet contents with an overall accuracy of 88%. There are more climate change discussions during September to December 2016, whereas the percentages of climate change deniers were lower in the same period. Public interests and attitudes on climate change were driven by extreme weather events and environmental policy changes. The developed methodology will shed lights on the utility of deep learning in natural language processing, while the results provide improved understanding of factors affecting public attitudes on climate change.},

abstract = {General Circulation Models (GCMs) allow for the simulation of several climate variables through the year 2100. GCM simulations, however, are too coarse to monitor climate change at a local scale in a local region. Hence, one needs to perform spatial downscaling for these simulations, where statistical downscaling is often used. Statistical downscaling is performed by utilizing the large-scale GCM outputs to forecast a local-scale field (e.g., temperature). In this paper, we develop a new deep learning approach, named AIG-TRANSFORMER, which employs a novel attention-based input grouping (AIG) neural network followed by a transformer, for the statistical downscaling of the weekly averages of maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures using GCM-simulated climatic fields (climate variables). We formulate the downscaling problem as a multivariate time series forecasting task, with multiple GCM-simulated climatic fields as input features. We employ an attention mechanism within the AIG network to give selective importance to the input features while reducing the size of the input fed to the transformer. To test AIG-TRANSFORMER, we perform the statistical downscaling over the Hackensack-Passaic Watershed, in northeast New Jersey. We compare our new deep learning approach against several existing machine learning methods including random forests, support vector regression and long short-term memory networks. Experimental results show that AIG-TRANSFORMER outperforms the existing methods for downscaling both the maximum and minimum temperatures, with a Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency coefficient of 0.84 for Tmax, and 0.85 for Tmin. We further apply AIG-TRANSFORMER to produce long-term projections over the 20 years period from 2030 to 2049, and report the annual means for maximum and minimum temperatures.},

abstract = {Climate change is now recognized as a global threat, and the literature surrounding it continues to increase exponentially. Expert bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are tasked with periodically assessing the literature to extract policy-relevant scientific conclusions that might guide policymakers. However, concerns have been raised that climate change research may be too voluminous for traditional literature review to adequately cover. It has been suggested that practices for literature review for scientific assessment be updated/augmented with semi-automated approaches from bibliometrics or scientometrics. In this study, we explored the feasibility of such recommendations for the scientific assessment of literature around socioeconomic climate change scenarios, so-called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). For automated literature reviews, most methods can be subsumed under two broad categories of classification tasks that use either (1) Natural Language Processing (NLP) or (2) Citation Networks. We performed two levels of classification tasks: (1) identifying SSP articles from a large corpus of climate change research and developing a database of SSP-related articles; (2) classifying SSP articles into different sectoral categories. We applied three machine learning algorithms for the text classification task: Multinomial Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear Support Vector Classification. However, the vocabulary of the SSP literature too closely resembles the vocabulary of broader climate change research for an NLP approach to be effective. We then attempted a citation network approach. We compared two sets of different community detection algorithms (the Louvain algorithm and the Fluid community detection algorithm), with one iteration of each algorithm containing 8 clusters and the next set containing 16. The citation network approach outperformed NLP with respect to false negatives. It also provided the ability to assess the uptake of SSPs across different sectors of climate change research. We concluded that, at the time of the study, the SSP corpus may not yet be large enough or diverse enough from broader climate change research for applying machine learning techniques for automated literature review. However, our research suggests that until there is a critical mass of SSP studies, there is the potential to divide labor between human and machine readers. Some of the data collection tasks currently done by human author teams, such as assessing scenario research, could be semi-automated to ensure and enhance the coverage of the literature. We also drew conclusions about the uptake of the SSP framework over its first 5 years in the broader climate change research literature. We observed that the uptake of SSPs in certain sub-disciplines (e.g., food systems) progressed slowly. Hence, to keep SSPs relevant, it may be fruitful to target SSP studies to particular research communities (e.g., sectors with slower uptake).},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a social network perspective for characterizing polarized information ecosystems. We apply our framework to a large-scale dataset of climate change conversations on Twitter. Leveraging a stance detection algorithm, we quantify the link-sharing behaviors of Believers and Disbelievers of anthropogenic climate change. We generate networks of web domains based on co-sharing by Believers and Disbelievers, and we characterize these networks in terms of both structure and content. While Believers outnumber Disbelievers in our dataset, our results showed that Disbelievers are responsible for sharing over three times as many unique domains. However, for every 10% increment in a domain’s proportion of Disbeliever sharers, the same domain is shared 58% less. Structurally, we observed that domain clusters associated with Believers were significantly smaller, denser, and less connected to other domains. Content-wise, we additionally found that Disbelievers were the near-exclusive sharers of majority right-wing and known fake news sources, whereas both Believers and Disbelievers shared left-wing and centrist domains. Collectively, our findings indicate that climate change Believers rely on a popular, well-consolidated, and exclusive set of mainstream web domains. In contrast, Disbelievers draw on a diverse and fragmented collection of fringe information sources. Although these results suggest the marginal status of climate change skepticism, they also troublingly point to its expansive ecosystem of online information featuring multiple entry points. We conclude with directions for future research and potential implications for science communication and climate change policymakers.},

abstract = {Temperature prediction is essential in our daily life, which guides us to pay attention to potential natural disasters, such as frost, drought and other weather conditions. Outdoor high-temperature operations in summer and work in the severe cold in winter both require accurate temperature forecasts, which could guide people to take more effective precautions to adopt to the changing temperature. In most cases, among plentiful existing temperature prediction models, the LDAPS (Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System) established by the Korea Meteorological Agency and the NU-WRF (NASA-Unified WRF) created by NASA are used for prediction, but these two models can still find inaccurate predictions in practical applications. Through further observation, it is found that these models are highly based on subjective experience or judgment, which leads to the problem of low prediction accuracy. Consequently, in this article, we intend to explore the LDAPS model in depth, by focusing on machine learning algorithms to correct the deviation of the model. To be more specific, we use a series of classical machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machine, linear regression, and tree-base ensemble learning methods (random forest and boosting) to adjust the predicted values via using the data set from the UCI machine learning repository. Through the comparison of these models, we found that the random forest and the boosting model perform best, whose RMSE (root of mean square error) on the test data set are 0.9718 and 0.9625 for maximum temperature prediction, 0.7598 and 0.6568 for minimum temperature predication respectively.},

abstract = {Physics-based models are often used to study engineering and environmental systems. The ability to model these systems is the key to achieving our future environmental sustainability and improving the quality of human life. This article focuses on simulating lake water temperature, which is critical for understanding the impact of changing climate on aquatic ecosystems and assisting in aquatic resource management decisions. General Lake Model (GLM) is a state-of-the-art physics-based model used for addressing such problems. However, like other physics-based models used for studying scientific and engineering systems, it has several well-known limitations due to simplified representations of the physical processes being modeled or challenges in selecting appropriate parameters. While state-of-the-art machine learning models can sometimes outperform physics-based models given ample amount of training data, they can produce results that are physically inconsistent. This article proposes a physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN) that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary strengths and improves the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physics-based models (by over 20% even with very little training data), while generating outputs consistent with physical laws. An important aspect of our PGRNN approach lies in its ability to incorporate the knowledge encoded in physics-based models. This allows training the PGRNN model using very few true observed data while also ensuring high prediction accuracy. Although we present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific and engineering disciplines where physics-based (also known as mechanistic) models are used.},

However, contemporary Earth System Models (ESM) are run at spatial resolutions too coarse for assessing effects this localized. Local scale projections can be obtained using statistical downscaling, a technique which uses historical climate observations to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping. Depending on statistical modeling choices, downscaled projections have been shown to vary significantly terms of accuracy and reliability. The spatio-temporal nature of the climate system motivates the adaptation of super-resolution image processing techniques to statistical downscaling. In our work, we present DeepSD, a generalized stacked super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) framework for statistical downscaling of climate variables. DeepSD augments SRCNN with multi-scale input channels to maximize predictability in statistical downscaling. We provide a comparison with Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation as well as three Automated-Statistical Downscaling approaches in downscaling daily precipitation from 1 degree (~100km) to 1/8 degrees (~12.5km) over the Continental United States. Furthermore, a framework using the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) platform is discussed for downscaling more than 20 ESM models with multiple emission scenarios.},

abstract = {The 2019 World Malaria Report confirms that Africa continue to bear the burden of malaria morbidity. The continent accounted for over 93% of the global malaria incidence reported in 2018. Despite the numerous multi-level and consultative efforts to combat this epidemic, malaria continues to claim thousands of human lives, especially those of children under 5 years of age. Since malaria is preventable and treatable, one of the solutions towards reducing the number of deaths is by implementing an effective malaria outbreak early warning system that can forecast malaria incidence long before they occur. This way, policymakers can put mitigation measures in place. Tapping into the success of machine learning algorithms in predicting disease outbreaks, we present a malaria outbreak prediction system that is anchored on the well-established correlation between certain climatic conditions and breeding environment of the malaria carrying vector (mosquito). Historical datasets on climate and malaria incidence are used to train nine machine learning algorithms and four best performing ones identified based on classification accuracy and computation performance. Preceding the models' development, reliability and correlation analysis was carried out on the data; this was then followed by reduction of the dimensionality of the feature space of the two datasets. Given the power of deep learning in handling selectivity variance, the malaria predictor system was developed based on the deep learning algorithm. Further, the evaluation of the system was done using the Simulator function in RapidMiner and the accuracy of the predictions assessed using an independent dataset that was not used in the models' development. With prediction accuracy of up to 99%, this system has the potential in contributing to the fight against malaria epidemic in Africa and elsewhere in the world.},

abstract = {Earth system models are developed with a tight coupling to target hardware, often containing specialized code predicated on processor characteristics. This coupling stems from using imperative languages that hard-code computation schedules and layout. We present a detailed account of optimizing the Finite Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core (FV3), improving productivity and performance. By using a declarative Python-embedded stencil domain-specific language and data-centric optimization, we abstract hardware-specific details and define a semi-automated workflow for analyzing and optimizing weather and climate applications. The workflow utilizes both local and full-program optimization, as well as user-guided fine-tuning. To prune the infeasible global optimization space, we automatically utilize repeating code motifs via a novel transfer tuning approach. On the Piz Daint supercomputer, we scale to 2,400 GPUs, achieving speedups of up to 3.92\texttimes{} over the tuned production implementation at a fraction of the original code.},

abstract = {While climate models have evolved over time to produce high fidelity and high resolution climate forecasts, visualization and analysis of the output of the model simulations has been limited, typically constrained to single dimensional charts for visualization and basic aggregate statistics for analytics. Same is true for the large troves of observational data available from meteorological stations all over the world. For richer understanding of climate and the impact of climate change, one needs computational tools that allow researchers, policymakers, and general public, to interact with the climate data. In this paper, we describe, webGlobe, a browser based GIS framework for interacting with climate data, and other datasets available in similar format. webGlobe is a unique resource that allows unprecedented access to climate data through a browser. The framework also allows for deploying machine learning based analytical applications on the climate data without putting computational burden on the client. Instead, webGlobe uses a client-server framework, where the server, deployed on a cloud infrastructure, allows for dynamic allocation of resources for running compute-intensive applications. The capabilities of the framework will be discussed in context of a use case: identifying extreme events from real and simulated climate data using a Gaussian process based change detection algorithm.},

Knowledge of the current temperature is crucial for thermal management. Additional knowledge of the rate of temperature change allows for predictions of temperatures in the near future, and, therefore, enables proactive management. However, neither is achievable with existing thermal sensors due to their limited number. Our technique is based on a neural network (NN) to predict the rate of temperature change based on performance counter readings and the current estimate of the thermal map. The thermal map is then updated based on the prediction. At design-time, we create training data for the NN by recording performance counters and the dynamic thermal map during the execution of mixed workloads. The thermal map is recorded with the help of an infrared (IR) camera. At run-time, our technique requires only performance counter readings. Our technique predicts temperature changes accurately. However, absolute temperature estimation suffers from instability.},

Based on the Landsat data of Kunming City from 2010 to 2018 and the meteorological data of Kunming City during the same period, this paper uses the method of pixel dichotomy, correlation analysis and other methods to analyze the temporal and spatial evolution of vegetation coverage and its response to climate change in the past 9 years. The results show that: (1) From 2010 to 2018, Kunming's average annual NDVI showed an upward trend, with an increase of 0.017/year. In 2018, the area covered by high vegetation was as high as 54%, and the ecological environment of Kunming City was significantly improved. (2) The change of NDVI in Kunming is insignificantly positively correlated with annual precipitation and insignificantly negatively correlated with annual average temperature, but has a higher correlation with annual average temperature and is more sensitive to temperature factors. (3) The correlation between NDVI change and elevation differentiation is significant within the elevation zone of 619 ~ 2642m in Kunming city, NDVI increases with the increase of elevation.},

Exploring the influence of the weather elements added to the model on the prediction results is also the focus of this paper. Two datasets are constructed for this purpose: the temperature forecast deviationdataset (dataset1) is constructed by using the temperature forecastsand the analysis field in NWP, a precipitation forecast dataset (dataset2) was constructed using the precipitation forecasts in NWP. The experimental results show that the model is effective. Using dataset1 as dataset for training, the accuracy rate of temperaturecorrected by PredTempwas increased by 3%compared to NWP; using dataset1 and dataset2 as dataset for training, the accuracy rate of temperature corrected by PredTemp was increased by 4%.

abstract = {Internal variability due to atmospheric circulation can dominate the thermodynamical signal present in the climate system for small spatial or short temporal scales, thus fundamentally limiting the detectability of forced climate signals. Dynamical adjustment techniques aim to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of trends in climate variables such as temperature by removing the influence of atmospheric circulation variability. Forced thermodynamical signals unrelated to circulation variability are then thought to remain in the residuals, allowing a more accurate quantification of changes even at the regional or decadal scale. The majority of these methods focus on climate variable’s averages, thus discounting important distributional features. Here we propose a machine learning dynamical adjustment method for the full temperature distribution that recognizes the stochastic nature of the relationship between the dynamical and thermodynamical components. Furthermore, we illustrate how this method enables evaluating how specific events would have unfolded in a different, counterfactual climate from a few decades ago, thereby characterizing the emergent effect of climatic changes over decadal time scales. We apply our method to observational data over Europe and over the past 70 years.},

abstract = {Different industries were transitioning to the utilization of Industry 4.0 tools such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques particularly Neural Network Modelling. The neural network application in pavement management is a serviceable tool to forecast the occurrence of pavement distress which leads to efficient allocation of budget for pavement maintenance. The aim of this research is to create a model for predicting the percentage occurrence of pothole in a flexible pavement and investigating the relative importance of the traffic and climate – associated factors. A database of 55 datasets was obtained including input parameters such as temperature, precipitation, pavement age, total Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) and AADT of heavy vehicles and target output which is the pothole % occurrence. Using the database, a backpropagation – neural network model (BP–NN) was established to forecast the percentage occurrence of potholes in a flexible pavement. The weights and biases generated from the simulation of the best model was employed to achieve a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to explore the effect of the input parameters to the pothole % occurrence. Results show that the BP-NN can effectively predict the pothole % occurrence in a flexible pavement and the best model generated has a topology of 5-12-1 (input-hidden-output). Additionally, the AADT of heavy vehicles is the most influential parameter affecting pothole % occurrence in flexible pavements based on the sensitivity analysis performed using Garson's algorithm.},

abstract = {The imaging time of the Geosynchronous Synthetic Aperture Radar (GEOSAR) system is up to thousands of seconds. The long-term operation of multiple devices during the imaging process of the GEOSAR system can easily cause the phase of each device to change with temperature. This change leads to the deterioration of azimuth phase correlation and affects the imaging performance of GEOSAR system. In order to solve this problem, this thesis designs and implements an on-orbit temperature phase compensation method for GEOSAR system. This method uses a combination of software and hardware, and adds three FLASH memory chips to the hardware circuit to store the temperature phase data table. The temperature phase data table is the phase change curve table of each device with temperature.FPGA calculates the corrected wave control code by looking up the table according to the latest received temperature telemetry values of each device in the system, the internal pre-stored temperature phase data table and the corresponding relationship table of the receiving and sending channels. It can realize the temperature phase compensation control of each device. Due to the complex working mode of the on-orbit system, the temperature phase data table will change accordingly under different working conditions. This method can also dynamically modify the temperature phase data table in the Flash according to the characteristics of the on-orbit working condition.In the process of the system working for 1000 seconds, we compare the test results before and after the temperature phase compensation of the system equipment (for example a certain type of cable). The change of the cable phase is reduced from nearly 40 degrees before compensation to less than 6 degrees after compensation. The deterioration of the pulse pressure peak sidelobe ratio is reduced from 1.92dB before compensation to 0.24dB after compensation. The deterioration of the integrated sidelobe ratio is reduced from 0.43dB before compensation to 0.01dB after compensation. The pulse pressure peak value is reduced by about 0.08dB before compensation. The pulse pressure amplitude is basically consistent with the ideal value. It can be seen that the temperature and phase compensation method can significantly improve the imaging performance of the GEOSAR system under long-term working conditions. At the same time, the method is simple to implement and has strong practicability. It can adapt to various complex working conditions of the system, and can be widely used in various SAR systems.},

In order to improve the accuracy of weather forecast, in this paper, an improved Gaussian disturbance weighted salp swarm algorithm (GDWSSA) and a GDWSSA-optimized kernel extreme learning machine (GDWSSA-KELM) model is proposed for weather forecasting. GDWSSA is proposed in the model to improve the shortcomings of the original algorithm (SSA) that the convergence speed is too slow and it is easy to fall into the local optimal solution. Simulation results show that GDWSSA outperforms SSA, GA, PSO and GWO in the benchmark functions. Then, GDWSSA optimizes the parameters in the KELM model called GDWSSA-KELM. Finally, the model is used to build the weather prediction model, the results show that the temperature prediction accuracy is better than the traditional machine learning methods. Therefore, the proposed GDWSSA-KELM model prediction model is promising to serve as a powerful auxiliary tool for weather forecast with excellent performance in temperature prediction.},

This paper proposes a climate event detection algorithm based on climate category word embedding(CEDCWE). This method combines the climate category word embedding and typical factors of climate events as a document representation model to express detailed information of climate documents and detect climate events efficiently and accurately. Compared with other methods, the CEDCWE algorithm can generate better climate document representations and climate event detection results. In the experiments, we acquire the datasets by a web crawler and evaluate our CEDCWE on real-world climate event detection tasks. Experimental results show that our CEDCWE is effective in climate document representation and outperforms typical methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the tower network, a novel, computationally lightweight deep neural network for multimodal data analytics and video prediction. The tower network is especially useful when it comes to combining different types of input data, a problem not greatly explored within deep learning. The architecture is further applied to a real-world example, where information from historic meteorological observations and numerical weather predictions are combined to produce high-quality forecasts of temperature for 1 to 6 hours into the future. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), and the tower network outperforms even state-of-the-art forecasts from the Norwegian weather forecasting app yr.no from 3 hours into the future. On average, the RMSE of the tower network is approximately 6% smaller than that of yr.no, and approximately 27% smaller than that of the raw numerical weather predictions.},

abstract = {As extreme-scale physics simulation becomes increasingly memory and storage expensive, the ability to access full simulation data for statistical analysis is becoming increasingly limited. The capability to perform in-situ statistical inference of state variables is becoming increasingly important for the comprehensive utilization of the huge amounts of information generated by these simulations. In this work, we report the first results fitting scalable Gaussian process regression to the state information of an expensive simulation in-situ. For this, spatial regression of upper atmosphere temperature data was performed using Julia coupled to the E3SM climate model. The resulting sparse Gaussian process model shows strong predictive performance using a small number of representative observations. These results provide the backbone for more general in-situ spatial inference with Gaussian process models in complex physics simulations.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a graph-based meta learning approach to separately predict water quantity and quality variables for river segments in stream networks. Given the heterogeneous water dynamic patterns in large-scale basins, we introduce an additional meta-learning condition based on physical characteristics of stream segments, which allows learning different sets of initial parameters for different stream segments. Specifically, we develop a representation learning method that leverages physical simulations to embed the physical characteristics of each segment. The obtained embeddings are then used to cluster river segments and add the condition for the meta-learning process. We have tested the performance of the proposed method for predicting daily water temperature and streamflow for the Delaware River Basin (DRB) over a 14 year period. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method in predicting target variables even using sparse training samples. We also show that our method can achieve robust performance with different numbers of clusterings.},

abstract = {This paper is to investigate the impact of meteorological factors and ozone on the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States, and to analyze the annual change patterns of the major influencing factors.Random forest modeling was performed for the correlation between the meteorological factors including relative humidity, 2-meter temperature, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, surface pressure, total precipitation, and total cloud cover, as well as ozone variations, and the daily new cases of COVID-19 in 497 counties in the US, so as to obtain the ranking of the impact of the above factors on the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. Statistical processing and K-means cluster analysis were performed on the modeling results.The modeling results showed that 73.6% of the counties were related to the modeling factors, while 26.4% were not significantly related to the modeling factors. Counties with R2 less than 0.3 were mainly distributed in Connecticut, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas; In the models with R2 greater than 0.3, the most important influencing factors were 2-meter temperature, UV radiation, and ozone variations. K-means cluster analysis showed that when the number of clusters K=3, the contour coefficient was the largest, and the clustering results at this point presented more obvious characteristics of geographic spatial distribution.Natural factors including relative humidity, 2-meter temperature, UV radiation, surface pressure, total precipitation, total cloud cover, and ozone could not fully explain the changes in the COVID-19 epidemic in the US. Temperature, UV radiation, and ozone were the most significant natural factors that affect the epidemic in the US. Higher 2-meter temperature and stronger UV radiation would help to curb the COVID-19 spread in the US. Lower temperatures and less ultraviolet radiation might be the cause of the epidemic surges in winter in the country.},

abstract = {Climate change is one of the major challenges to human beings in our time. It brings many unexpected disasters which cause drastic losses including lives and properties. To better understand climate change, scientists developed various Global Climate Models (GCMs) to simulate the global climate and make projections for future climate values. These global climate models have coarse grids (i.e., low resolutions both in space and time) due to limitations of computing power and simulation time. Although they are helpful in predicting large scale long term trend in climate, they are too coarse for impact analysis in smaller scales such as in regional or local scale. However, climate conditions in regional or local scale are very important in making decisions related to climate conditions such as infrastructure, transportation and evacuation, as they highly depend on small scale climate conditions. In this paper, we proposed YNet, a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with skip connections and fusion capabilities to perform downscaling for climate variables, on multiple GCMs directly rather than on reanalysis data. We analyzed and compared our proposed method with four other methods on datasets of three climate variables: mean precipitation, and extreme values (maximum temperature and minimum temperature). The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Automobile Climate Control Systems (CCS) are known to be heavy energy consumers. To help reduce CCS energy consumption, this paper presents an adaptive automated agent, MDP Agent for Climate control Systems (MACS), which provides drivers with advice as to how to set their CCS. First, we present a model which has 78% accuracy in predicting drivers' reactions to different advice in different situations. Using the prediction model, we designed a Markov Decision Process which solution provided the ad- vising policy for MACS. Through empirical evaluation using an electric car, with 83 human subjects, we show that MACS successfully reduced the energy consumption of the subjects by 33% compared to subjects who were not equipped with MACS. MACS also outperformed the state-of-the-art Social agent for Advice Provision (SAP).},

These waters have a wide distribution of coral reefs and abundant fish potential. Many fish potential is inseparable from the presence of phytoplankton, which contains chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature (SST) or known as the upwelling phenomenon. The upwelling phenomenon can be seen through remote sensing technology by utilizing JAXA / GCOM-C / LV3 imagery. In this study, the researchers would like to analyze the effect of sea surface temperature on the distribution of chlorophyll throughout 2020 in NTT waters using Google Earth Engine. From the simple regression results, we found that the correlation of sea surface temperature to the distribution of chlorophyll in east Nusa Tenggara waters is very low. However, sea surface temperature still affects the presence of chlorophyll-a.},

abstract = {Computational approaches to climate modeling have advanced rapidly in recent years, as have the tools and techniques associated with the construction of artificial life, artificial societies, and social simulation experiments. However, the use of computer simulation to study the effects of climate change on human conflict and cooperation is still relatively rare. In this article, we consider some of the challenges and opportunities that face interdisciplinary teams seeking to develop models that incorporate human, ecological, and natural systems. There is an urgency to this task because climate-abetted socio-economic and inter-cultural stress can trigger conflict at all scales, which exacerbates human suffering. We argue that the interdisciplinary community of scholars with expertise in multi-agent artificial intelligence simulation and artificial life modeling have a unique opportunity to collaborate and address these challenges by attempting to develop artificial societies capable of uncovering adaptive pathways that can minimize social conflict and maximize cooperation in the face of climate-abetted social and ecological change.},

The technique discussed is targeted toward unit imputation of a missing surface temperature value, for a specific weather station, on a specific date. The imputation method relies solely on the available daily maximum temperature data set of the weather station. We propose a hybrid approach, K-Nearest Temperature Trends (KNTT) which identifies a cluster of K years, showing nearest temperature trends to that of the year of the missing value date. Next, the missing temperature value of the date is imputed by taking average of the values for the same date of the identified K-Trends years. We used the data set of temperature values from 38 weather stations of Pakistan, spanning over 30 years (1980-2010), for our experiments. We evaluated our methodology by using ME, MAE and RMSE and the results show that our technique imputed correctly, with an error rate less than the standard KNN technique.},

There is a need to analyze the effects of climatic patterns on the spread of CCHF to allow high-risk countries to better prepare for possible outbreaks.

abstract = {Atmospheric temperature is one of the dominating atmospheric parameters that impact on the propagation of radio waves through the troposphere. Adequate knowledge of the atmospheric temperature of an environment is therefore essential for radio wave propagation planning. In this study, thirty-four (34)-year (1981-2014) atmospheric temperature data of 10 selected weather stations across the climatic zones of Nigeria, obtained from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) through the data bank of the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adaptive Land Use (WASCAL) of the Federal University of Technology Minna, Nigeria was used in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the prediction of mean monthly atmospheric temperature. The ANN architecture comprised of 2 inputs (the climatic zones and the corresponding month for the mean monthly atmospheric temperature), 1 hidden layer and 1 output (atmospheric temperature). Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used with 9 different pairs of activation functions formed from 3 activation functions (logsig, purelin and tansig). The number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied from 33-39 with an increasing steps of 2 (33, 35, 37 and 39). The network architecture of 2-37-1 (2 inputs, 37 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output), with tansig/tansig pair of activation functions had the least mean square error value of 2.2280, and was used for the prediction process. The computed correlation values for measured and predicted atmospheric temperature ranged from 0.9733 to 0.8787, depicting strong positive correlation and good accuracy of the developed model. Comparisons of the measured and the ANN predicted atmospheric temperature across selected stations in the climatic zones of Nigeria, showed that the developed model can effectively predict mean monthly atmospheric temperature, using month and climatic zone as input parameters.},

abstract = {Developing and maintaining resilient transportation infrastructure is a key strategy for meeting several UN sustainable development goals in the face of climate change-driven extreme flooding events. We present a framework for performing data-driven vulnerability analysis for flooding on existing transportation networks, and use this analysis to inform decision-making about investments for climate adaptation. We apply this approach to study the potential impacts of severe flooding on regional mobility in Senegal, using a combination of flood hazard maps and a travel demand model based on call detail record data. We use the estimated number of infeasible trips as a direct measure of flooding-induced mobility impacts, as well as an objective for minimizing these impacts. We then compare three alternative road network upgrade strategies to assess the extent to which each strategy would preserve network functionality under a given flooding scenario. We illustrate that strategies driven solely by travel demand can lead to underinvestment in roads that are at risk of flooding, while solely focusing on repairing flooded road segments neglects the criticality of those repairs to mobility. For example, in a 100 year flooding scenario with a fixed budget, our strategy that considers both flooding and mobility data can achieve a 53% reduction in the number of infeasible trips, while a strategy that just considers flooding data achieves only a 38% reduction for the same cost. Our framework can be applied more broadly to integrate information from a variety of sources about climate hazards and potential human impacts to make better informed decisions about investments in critical infrastructure systems.},
